# Quantum Physics Overview

Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is the foundational theory describing nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It introduces core concepts such as quantization of energy levels, wave–particle duality, and the probabilistic nature of measurement outcomes. Instead of deterministic trajectories, quantum systems are represented by wavefunctions whose evolution follows the Schrödinger equation.

Key milestones include Planck's solution to blackbody radiation, Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect, and the development of matrix and wave mechanics by Heisenberg and Schrödinger. Subsequent work established uncertainty relations, spin, and the Pauli exclusion principle, culminating in the Copenhagen interpretation that emphasizes observation and measurement.

Modern quantum physics enables technologies ranging from semiconductors and lasers to quantum information science. Contemporary research explores entanglement, quantum computing qubits, topological phases of matter, and attempts to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity.
