# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics is a fast-growing field of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. It challenges our classical intuitition of how the world works, introducing concepts that govern the microscopic universe.

## Key Principles

*   **Quantization**: Energy and other physical properties are not continuous but occur in discrete packets called "quanta".
*   **Wave-Particle Duality**: Fundamental entities like electrons and photons exhibit properties of both particles and waves. They can diffract and interfere like waves, yet interact at specific points like particles.
*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: There is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, can be known simultaneously.
*   **Superposition**: Systems can exist in multiple potential states at the same time until a measurement is made, which "collapses" the system into one of the definite states.
*   **Entanglement**: Particles can become correlated in such a way that the state of one instantaneously determines the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them.

## Impact

The principles of quantum physics form the foundation for much of modern technology, including:
*   Semiconductors and transistors (computing)
*   Lasers
*   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
*   Nuclear energy
*   Quantum computing (emerging)
