# Quantum Physics Roundup

## Snapshot
- Quantum mechanics explains how matter and light behave on atomic and subatomic scales.
- The theory underpins every modern quantum discipline: chemistry, biology, field theory, technology, and information science.

## Key Principles
1. **Wave-particle duality** – particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, depending on how they are observed.
2. **Quantization** – energy, charge, and other quantities occur in discrete packets, leading to phenomena like atomic emission spectra.
3. **Superposition** – systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured, enabling interference effects.
4. **Entanglement** – measurements on one particle instantaneously influence its entangled partner, regardless of separation.
5. **Uncertainty** – Heisenberg's principle limits simultaneous knowledge of complementary properties such as position and momentum.

## Modern Impact
- **Quantum information science** harnesses superposition and entanglement for computing and secure communication.
- **Quantum technologies** (sensors, simulators, materials) exploit quantized interactions for precision and performance beyond classical limits.
- **Quantum chemistry and biology** use the theory to model complex molecular behavior and emerging biological quantum effects.
