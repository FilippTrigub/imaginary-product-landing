# Quantum Physics Roundup (February 4, 2026)

## Core Principles
- **Superposition:** Qubits encode 0 and 1 simultaneously, underpinning quantum parallelism for algorithms such as Shor's and Grover's.
- **Entanglement:** Correlated particles enable quantum key distribution and emerging quantum internet prototypes spanning 100 km+ fiber links.
- **Measurement & Decoherence:** Observation collapses quantum states; error-correction advances (e.g., IBM's Condor) mitigate noise in >1,000-qubit systems.
- **Wave-Particle Duality:** Drives interferometric sensors used in gravitational-wave detection and next-gen microscopy.
- **Uncertainty Principle:** Sets limits for precision metrology, informing ultra-accurate clocks and navigation systems.

## Recent Developments (2023-2025)
- IBM's 1,121-qubit **Condor** processor progressed logical qubit error correction.
- Google's **Sycamore** delivered quantum advantage in molecular simulations for battery research.
- China's photonic **Jiuzhang 3.0** showcased supremacy in optimization workloads.
- Quantum networks (EU Quantum Internet Alliance, US DOE prototypes) distribute entanglement for secure communications; satellite relays extend reach globally.
- Nitrogen-vacancy diamond sensors enable nanoscale MRI; topological qubits (e.g., Majorana demos) aim for fault tolerance.

## Outlook
Quantum technologies are projected to drive trillion-dollar economic impact by 2035, contingent on solving scalability, standardization, and ethical/security challenges (post-quantum cryptography rollout, quantum hacking risks).
