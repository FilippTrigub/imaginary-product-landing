# Quantum Physics Roundup (February 4, 2026)

## Core Principles
- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Light and matter show both wave and particle behavior, evidenced by interference experiments.[1]
- **Superposition & Entanglement**: Quantum states can exist in multiple configurations simultaneously and share correlations across distance, foundational for quantum computing and cryptography.[1]
- **Uncertainty & Quantization**: Position/momentum pairs obey Heisenberg limits, while energy states remain discrete, explaining atomic spectra and photoelectric observations.[1]

## Recent Developments (2025–2026)
1. **IBM Condor Processor**: January 2026 announcement highlighted progress toward fault-tolerant logical qubits using a 1,121-qubit device, pushing scalable quantum computing.[1]
2. **Google Quantum AI**: Late 2025 demo reduced decoherence by ~40% in >100 qubits, strengthening claims of quantum advantage.[1]
3. **Satellite Entanglement Links**: China’s Jinan-1 microsatellite enabled a 12,900 km entanglement uplink between China and South Africa, proving practical space-based quantum networks.[2]
4. **SpeQtre CubeSat**: Launched November 2025 by SpeQtral/STFC to validate low-cost entanglement-based QKD payloads in orbit.[2]
5. **Quantum Magnetometry**: December 2025 NIST/DARPA prototype used superposition-enhanced sensors to detect astrophysical signals beyond classical limits.[1]
6. **Room-Temperature Quantum States**: February 2026 metamaterial breakthrough stabilized Bose-Einstein condensates near ambient temperatures, lowering cooling barriers.[1]

## Outlook
Quantum physics fundamentals remain intact, but instrumentation, materials, and space-based experiments continue to extend reach toward practical quantum networks, sensing, and energy storage.
