History is the study of the past and how it shapes societies over time.
It draws from artifacts, written records, oral traditions, and scientific evidence.
Historians compare sources to build narratives about cultures, conflicts, and daily life.
Major eras often include ancient civilizations, the medieval period, the early modern age, and the contemporary world.
Exploration, trade, and migration connected regions and accelerated the exchange of ideas and technologies.
Revolutions in politics, science, and industry transformed how people live and govern themselves.
Remembering history helps communities preserve heritage and learn from earlier choices.
