History is the study of past events, tracing how societies change over time.
It records the rise and fall of civilizations, the spread of ideas, and the
everyday experiences of people who shaped their world.

Ancient history highlights early agriculture, writing systems, and trade
networks that connected distant regions. The classical era introduced
philosophy, law, and art that still influence modern life.

The medieval period saw shifts in power, religion, and technology, while the
early modern age brought exploration, scientific breakthroughs, and new forms
of governance. Industrialization transformed economies and accelerated urban
growth, setting the stage for global conflicts and rapid innovation.

Modern history focuses on human rights, decolonization, digital revolutions,
and the ongoing challenge of balancing progress with sustainability.
