## How to Use

### For Python:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the exercise directory:
   ```bash
   cd beginner-exercises/python
   ```
3. Open the exercise file in your editor
4. Write your solution below the "Your solution here:" comment
5. Run the file:
   ```bash
   python 01_hello_world.py
   ```

### For JavaScript:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the exercise directory:
   ```bash
   cd beginner-exercises/javascript
   ```
3. Open the exercise file in your editor
4. Write your solution below the "Your solution here:" comment
5. Run the file:
   ```bash
   node 01_hello_world.js
   ```

## Tips for Success

1. **Read Carefully**: Make sure you understand what the exercise is asking before you start coding.

2. **Start Simple**: Begin with the easy exercises and work your way up.

3. **Test Often**: Run your code frequently to catch errors early.

4. **Don't Rush**: Take your time to understand each concept.

5. **Experiment**: Try different approaches and see what works.

6. **Use Comments**: Add comments to explain your thinking.

7. **Debug Systematically**: If something doesn't work, use print statements to understand what's happening.

8. **Google is Your Friend**: Looking up syntax and concepts is part of programming.

9. **Practice Regularly**: Consistency is key to learning programming.

10. **Ask for Help**: Don't be afraid to seek help when stuck.

## Learning Path

We recommend following this progression:

1. Complete exercises 1-7 to build a foundation
2. Move to exercises 8-12 to learn about functions and data structures
3. Tackle exercises 13-17 for more complex problems
4. Challenge yourself with exercises 18-20

## Common Debugging Tips

- **Python**: Use `print()` statements to debug
- **JavaScript**: Use `console.log()` statements to debug
- Check for typos in variable names
- Make sure indentation is correct (especially in Python)
- Verify that all parentheses and brackets are closed

## Next Steps

After completing these exercises:

1. Try building small projects (calculator app, to-do list, etc.)
2. Explore more advanced topics (OOP, APIs, databases)
3. Contribute to open-source projects
4. Build your own portfolio projects

Happy coding!
