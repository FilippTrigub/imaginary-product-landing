# Recursion Practice in Python

## Exercise 1: Factorial Function
Implement a recursive function `factorial(n)` that returns the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`. Raise a `ValueError` if `n` is negative. Write unit tests covering base cases and typical inputs.

## Exercise 2: Fibonacci Sequence
Write a recursive function `fibonacci(n)` that returns the nth Fibonacci number (with `fibonacci(0) = 0` and `fibonacci(1) = 1`). Optimize the implementation using memoization to avoid redundant calculations. Add tests for several values of `n`.

## Exercise 3: Sum of Digits
Create a recursive function `sum_of_digits(n)` that returns the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. Ensure the function handles large integers. Provide examples demonstrating the recursion.

## Exercise 4: Binary Search
Implement a recursive binary search function `binary_search(nums, target)` that returns the index of `target` in a sorted list `nums`, or `-1` if `target` is not present. Include tests covering edge cases, such as empty lists and repeated elements.

## Exercise 5: Palindrome Check
Write a recursive function `is_palindrome(s)` that determines whether a string `s` is a palindrome, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters. Supply examples and test cases illustrating the behavior.
