# Beginner Coding Exercises: JavaScript Loops

## Warm-Up: Understanding Loops
1. **Repeat a message**: Write a `for` loop that prints "Hello, Nova!" five times in the console.
2. **Count from 1 to 10**: Create a `for` loop that logs the numbers 1 through 10.
3. **Count down**: Use a `for` loop to log the numbers 10 down to 1.

## Working with Arrays
4. **List favorite fruits**: Given an array `const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]`, use a `for` loop to log each fruit.
5. **Sum of numbers**: Given `const nums = [2, 4, 6, 8]`, use a loop to calculate the total and log it.
6. **Find the largest**: Given `const temps = [72, 68, 75, 70]`, loop through to determine the highest temperature.

## While and Do-While Practice
7. **Guess countdown**: Using a `while` loop, start from 5 and count down to 0, logging each number.
8. **Repeat until ready**: Use a `do...while` loop that keeps logging "Loading" until a variable `ready` becomes `true`.
9. **Pin attempts**: Simulate entering a PIN by counting attempts with a `while` loop; stop after three tries.

## Loop + Conditionals
10. **Even numbers**: Loop from 1 to 20 and log only the even numbers.
11. **FizzBuzz Lite**: For numbers 1 to 15, log "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and the number otherwise.
12. **Find target**: Given `const scores = [12, 20, 18, 25]`, loop through to find if `18` exists and log a message when found.

## Building Patterns
13. **Simple triangle**: Use a loop to build and log the following pattern one line at a time:
```
*
**
***
****
```
14. **Number square**: Write a loop that logs lines forming:
```
1234
1234
1234
1234
```
15. **Multiplication table**: Create nested loops to generate the multiplication table (1-5) and log each equation like `2 x 3 = 6`.

## Mini Projects
16. **Total price calculator**: Given an array of item prices, loop through to calculate and log the total cost.
17. **Average quiz score**: Loop through quiz scores to compute the average and log it with a friendly message.
18. **Countdown timer**: Write a function using a loop that counts down from any starting number to zero and logs "Blast off!".
19. **Shopping list formatter**: Given an array of items, loop to output a numbered shopping list.
20. **Simple password checker**: Loop over an array of username/password pairs to check if a provided username exists.
