## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Navigate to any exercise folder
2. Open the `exercise.js` file
3. Read the instructions in the comments
4. Write your solution
5. Run the tests with `node test.js`
6. Check your solution against `solution.js` if you get stuck

## 📖 How to Use

Each exercise folder contains:
- `exercise.js` - Your workspace with instructions
- `test.js` - Automated tests to verify your solution
- `solution.js` - Reference solution (try not to peek!)
- `README.md` - Detailed explanation and hints

## 🎯 Learning Path

**Beginners:** Start with Variables & Data Types, then move through Functions, Arrays, and Objects.

**Intermediate:** Focus on Array Methods, DOM Manipulation, and Challenges.

**Practice Tips:**
- Try to solve each exercise without looking at the solution
- Run tests frequently to check your progress
- Experiment with different approaches
- Read error messages carefully - they're helpful!
