# Python Collections Practice Track

Welcome! This track focuses on helping beginners become comfortable with Python's everyday collection types—lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Each exercise file includes:

- **Why it matters**: quick context on the skill you're practicing.
- **Starter code**: a snippet to copy into your editor.
- **Tasks**: numbered prompts that build confidence step by step.
- **Stretch goals**: optional twists to encourage experimentation.

## How to Work Through the Track

1. Open the files in this folder in order. They move from lists to tuples and dictionaries, then toward mixing multiple collection types.
2. For every exercise, run your solution and print intermediate variables so you can see how the collection changes.
3. When you're stuck, try writing out the steps in plain English, then translate each sentence into a line of Python.
4. After solving an exercise, add one more related change of your own (e.g., new input, extra validation) to deepen your understanding.

## Files

- `lists.md` – Fundamental list operations, slicing, sorting, and list comprehension warmups.
- `tuples_and_unpacking.md` – Working with immutable data, swaps, and returning multiple values.
- `dicts_and_sets.md` – Counting items, deduplicating data, and building lookup tables.
- `mixed_practice.md` – Mini-project prompts that combine lists, dicts, sets, and tuples in realistic scenarios.

Each file contains five or more exercises so you can practice at least 20 focused tasks.
