  Coding Challenge 1: Two Sum

  Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
  You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

  Example:
  Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
  Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
  return [0, 1].
*/

const twoSum = (nums, target) => {
  // Your code here
};

/*
  Coding Challenge 2: Palindrome Checker

  Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

  Example:
  "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
  "race a car" is not a palindrome.
*/

const isPalindrome = (str) => {
  // Your code here
};

/*
  Coding Challenge 3: FizzBuzz

  Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
  But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.
  For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
*/

const fizzBuzz = () => {
  // Your code here
};

/*
  Coding Challenge 4: Anagram Checker

  Given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first.
  An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
  typically using all the original letters exactly once.

  Example:
  isAnagram('anagram', 'nagaram') // => true
  isAnagram('rat', 'car') // => false
*/

const isAnagram = (str1, str2) => {
  // Your code here
};

/*
  Coding Challenge 5: Factorial Calculator

  Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
  The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!,
  is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

  Example:
  factorial(5) // => 120 (i.e., 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
*/

const factorial = (num) => {
  // Your code here
};
