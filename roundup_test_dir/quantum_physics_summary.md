# Quantum Physics: A Summary

## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum mechanics is the study of matter and its interactions with energy at the atomic and subatomic scale. Unlike classical physics, which describes the everyday world, quantum mechanics governs phenomena at the smallest scales — where particles behave in ways that often seem counterintuitive and paradoxical.

## Key Principles

### Wave–Particle Duality
Quantum objects (photons, electrons, etc.) exhibit properties of both waves and particles. The famous **double-slit experiment** demonstrates that particles can produce interference patterns like waves, yet are detected as individual particles.

### Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927, this principle states that certain pairs of physical properties — such as position and momentum — cannot both be precisely measured at the same time. The more accurately one is known, the less accurately the other can be determined.

### Quantum Entanglement
When two particles become entangled, measuring a property of one instantly determines the corresponding property of the other, regardless of the distance between them. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."

### Wave Function Collapse
Before measurement, a quantum system exists in a superposition of states described by a wave function. Upon observation, the wave function "collapses" to a single definite state.

### Pauli Exclusion Principle
No two identical fermions (e.g., electrons) can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This principle is fundamental to the structure of atoms and the stability of matter.

## Brief History

- **1900** — Max Planck introduces the idea of energy quanta.
- **1905** — Albert Einstein explains the photoelectric effect using quantized photons.
- **1913** — Niels Bohr proposes quantized electron orbits in atoms.
- **1925–1926** — Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger develop matrix and wave mechanics.
- **1928** — Paul Dirac publishes his relativistic wave equation, predicting antimatter.

## Recent Developments (2025–2026)

- **Hidden Quantum Geometry** (Feb 2026): Researchers discovered a hidden quantum geometry inside materials that steers electrons, echoing how gravity warps light in space.
- **Magnetic Order & Superconductivity** (Jan 2026): Physicists found that hidden magnetic order plays a key role in the pseudogap state preceding superconductivity.
- **Phonon Laser** (Jan 2026): Engineers created a "phonon laser" generating tiny vibrations on a microchip, potentially transforming future electronics.
- **Quantum Encryption at City Scale** (Feb 2026): Quantum key distribution (QKD) was demonstrated at city-sized distances for the first time.
- **Quantum Batteries** (Jan 2026): New designs for quantum batteries could quadruple qubit capacity.
