# History Overview

Human history spans millennia of cultural, scientific, and social change. Early civilizations grew around rivers, developed writing systems, and built trade networks that connected distant regions. The classical era saw the rise of empires, philosophy, and advances in art and engineering.

The medieval period introduced new religious movements, shifting political boundaries, and the growth of universities. The early modern era brought exploration, the printing press, and the scientific revolution, reshaping how knowledge spread and how societies understood the world.

In the modern age, industrialization transformed economies and cities, while democratic movements expanded rights and representation. The twentieth and twenty-first centuries have been marked by rapid technological progress, global interdependence, and ongoing efforts to address social and environmental challenges.
