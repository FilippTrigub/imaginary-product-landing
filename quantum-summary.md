# Quantum Physics Overview

## Core Ideas
- Quantum mechanics describes nature at atomic and subatomic scales, where energy and matter exhibit both particle and wave behavior.
- Fundamental principles include wave-particle duality, superposition of states, and quantization of observable properties such as energy levels.
- Measurement collapses a system's wavefunction to a definite outcome, introducing probabilistic predictions governed by the Born rule.

## Historical Context
- Early 20th-century work by Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, and Schrödinger established the theory to explain blackbody radiation, photoelectric effect, and atomic spectra.
- The Copenhagen interpretation provided the first widely accepted philosophical framing, though alternatives like many-worlds and pilot-wave theory remain topics of debate.

## Modern Applications
- Quantum field theory extends the framework to relativistic particles and underpins the Standard Model of particle physics.
- Technologies such as semiconductors, lasers, MRI scanners, and quantum information systems (qubits, entanglement-based communication) rely on quantum principles.
- Contemporary research explores quantum computing algorithms, error correction, and quantum sensing to surpass classical limits.
