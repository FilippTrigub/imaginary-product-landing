# Quantum Physics Roundup

## Overview
Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of matter and light at atomic and subatomic scales, where classical intuition fails. It underpins quantum chemistry, biology, field theory, technology, and information science.

## Key Principles
- **Wave-particle duality:** Particles exhibit both localized and delocalized behaviors depending on how they are observed.
- **Quantization:** Energy, angular momentum, and other observables often take on discrete values.
- **Uncertainty principle:** Fundamental limits exist on simultaneously knowing pairs of properties such as position and momentum.
- **Superposition:** Systems can occupy multiple states at once until measurement collapses them.

## Modern Applications
- Quantum computing exploits superposition and entanglement for parallel computation.
- Quantum communication leverages entanglement for secure key distribution.
- Quantum sensing achieves extreme precision in timekeeping and navigation.
