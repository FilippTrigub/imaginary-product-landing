# NovaSphere - The Future of Personal Computing

This repository contains the landing page for NovaSphere, an imaginary product that features holographic interfaces and advanced computing technologies.

## Coding Challenges (JavaScript)

1. **Hologram Carousel Controller** – Build a class that manages hologram panels, supports `next()`, `previous()`, and jump-to-index navigation, and emits events when transitions finish.
2. **Gesture Command Parser** – Implement a parser that converts gesture strings like `pinch-zoom rotate-left swipe-up` into executable command objects with validation and error reporting.
3. **Adaptive Power Scheduler** – Write a function that, given workload predictions and battery levels, schedules tasks into low/high power cores while maximizing throughput under energy constraints.
4. **Quantum Cache Simulator** – Create a simulation of a two-level cache where hits, misses, and eviction policies are configurable, then output performance stats after processing instruction traces.
