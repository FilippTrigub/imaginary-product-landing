## Coding Challenges

Here are some coding challenges to test your skills:

### Challenge 1: Reverse a String

Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed. Do not use any built-in string reversal functions or slicing (e.g., `[::-1]`).

```python
def reverse_string(s):
    # Your code here
    pass
```

### Challenge 2: Find the First Non-Repeating Character

Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns the first non-repeating character. If all characters repeat, return `None`.

```python
def first_non_repeating_char(s):
    # Your code here
    pass
```

### Challenge 3: Implement a Basic Calculator

Write a Python function that takes a string representing a simple arithmetic expression (e.g., "1 + 2 * 3", "10 / 2 - 1") and returns the result. The expression will only contain non-negative integers, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators, and spaces. Assume valid input.

```python
def calculate(expression):
    # Your code here
    pass
```
