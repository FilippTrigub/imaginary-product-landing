# Quantum Physics

Quantum physics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

Here are some of the core concepts:

*   **Wave-particle duality:** This principle states that every particle or quantum entity may be described as either a particle or a wave.
*   **Uncertainty principle:** This states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa.
*   **Superposition:** A quantum system can be in multiple states at the same time. For example, an electron can be in multiple locations at once.
*   **Entanglement:** This is a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles are linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, no matter how far apart they are.
