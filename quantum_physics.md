# Quantum Physics

Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

## Key Concepts

*   **Quantization**: Physical properties are quantized, meaning they can only take on discrete values.
*   **Wave-particle duality**: Light and matter exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
*   **Uncertainty principle**: It is impossible to simultaneously know with perfect accuracy certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, such as position and momentum.
*   **Quantum entanglement**: A physical phenomenon that occurs when a pair or group of particles is generated in such a way that the quantum state of each particle of the pair or group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distance.

## Applications

Quantum mechanics has had a profound impact on technology. Some applications include:

*   **Lasers**: Used in everything from Blu-ray players to surgical procedures.
*   **Transistors**: The fundamental building block of modern electronics.
*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: A medical imaging technique used to form pictures of the anatomy and the physiological processes of the body.
*   **Quantum computing**: A new type of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations that are impossible for classical computers.
