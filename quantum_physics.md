# Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

## Key Concepts

*   **Quantization**: Physical properties like energy, momentum, and angular momentum are restricted to discrete values.
*   **Wave-particle duality**: Light and matter exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
*   **Uncertainty principle**: It is impossible to simultaneously know with perfect accuracy certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum.
*   **Quantum superposition**: A quantum system can be in multiple states at the same time. The act of measurement causes the system to collapse into one of the possible states.
*   **Quantum entanglement**: A physical phenomenon that occurs when a pair or group of particles is generated, interacts, or shares spatial proximity in such a way that the quantum state of each particle of the pair or group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance.
