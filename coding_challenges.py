# Blackbox Coding Challenges

# Challenge 1: Palindrome Checker
#
# A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters
# that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "madam" or "racecar").
#
# Write a function `is_palindrome(s)` that returns `True` if the given
# string `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise. The function should be
# case-insensitive and should ignore spaces and punctuation.
#
# Example:
# is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama") == True
# is_palindrome("race a car") == False

def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    # Your code here
    pass

# Challenge 2: Fibonacci Sequence
#
# The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum
# of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
#
# Write a function `fibonacci(n)` that returns the n-th number in the
# Fibonacci sequence.
#
# Example:
# fibonacci(0) == 0
# fibonacci(1) == 1
# fibonacci(9) == 34

def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    # Your code here
    pass

# Challenge 3: Two Sum
#
# Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the
# indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
#
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you
# may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.
#
# Example:
# two_sum(nums=[2, 7, 11, 15], target=9) == [0, 1]
# two_sum(nums=[3, 2, 4], target=6) == [1, 2]

def two_sum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    # Your code here
    pass

# Challenge 4: Anagram Checker
#
# An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a
# different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters
# exactly once (e.g., "listen" is an anagram of "silent").
#
# Write a function `is_anagram(s1, s2)` that returns `True` if `s2` is an
# anagram of `s1`, and `False` otherwise. The comparison should be
# case-insensitive.
#
# Example:
# is_anagram("listen", "silent") == True
# is_anagram("rat", "car") == False

def is_anagram(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
    # Your code here
    pass

# Challenge 5: FizzBuzz
#
# Write a function `fizzbuzz(n)` that prints the numbers from 1 to `n`.
# But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for
# the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of
# both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
#
# Example:
# fizzbuzz(5) should print:
# 1
# 2
# Fizz
# 4
# Buzz

def fizzbuzz(n: int):
    # Your code here
    pass
