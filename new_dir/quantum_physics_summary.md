# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics is a fundamental field of science that studies matter and energy at the most basic levels, aiming to understand the building blocks of nature. It emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to explain phenomena that classical physics could not.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Quantization:** Matter and energy exist in discrete packets called "quanta," each with a minimum, indivisible value. For example, light is composed of photons, which are quanta of energy. In quantum systems, certain properties like energy, momentum, and angular momentum are quantized, meaning they can only take on specific discrete values.
*   **Wave-Particle Duality:** Quantum objects, such as light and electrons, exhibit characteristics of both waves and particles, depending on how they are measured. The double-slit experiment famously demonstrates this duality.
*   **Probability and Wave Functions:** In quantum mechanics, the precise location of a particle cannot be definitively predicted. Instead, particles exist in a "haze of probability," described mathematically by a "wave function" that gives the probability of finding a particle at a particular location and time with a specific momentum.
*   **Atomic Structure:** Quantum physics revolutionized our understanding of atoms. It describes electrons as being distributed within orbitals, which represent probability distributions of where an electron might be found, rather than orbiting the nucleus in fixed paths. Electrons can jump between these orbitals by gaining or losing energy.

## Significance:

Quantum mechanics is the foundational theory for describing the behavior of matter and light at atomic and subatomic scales. Its predictions have been extensively verified through experiments.

## Modern Applications:

The principles of quantum physics are essential to numerous modern technologies, including:

*   Lasers
*   Transistors
*   Semiconductors
*   MRI machines
*   GPS systems
*   LEDs
*   Solar panels
*   Smartphones
