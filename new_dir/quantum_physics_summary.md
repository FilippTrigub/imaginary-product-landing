# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics is a fundamental branch of science that explores the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. It emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to explain phenomena that classical physics could not.

## Key Concepts:
*   **Quanta:** Matter and energy exist in discrete packets.
*   **Wave-Particle Duality:** Quantum objects can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like characteristics.
*   **Electron Orbitals:** Electrons are described by probability distributions within orbitals, not fixed planetary orbits.
*   **Superposition:** Objects can exist in multiple states or locations simultaneously.
*   **Entanglement:** Interacting quantum objects remain linked, even when separated.
*   **Quantum Tunneling:** Objects can pass through barriers they classically shouldn't be able to.

Quantum physics is essential for understanding the universe at its smallest scales and forms the basis for modern technologies like lasers, semiconductors, MRI machines, and GPS. It also drives the development of advanced technologies such as quantum computing.
