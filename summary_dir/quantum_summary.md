# Quantum Physics Roundup

Quantum mechanics explains the behavior of matter and light at atomic and subatomic scales. Its probabilistic view departs from classical determinism, capturing how particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties via wavefunctions.

## Key Principles
- **Wave-Particle Duality:** Experiments such as the double-slit show particles forming interference patterns, revealing intrinsic wave behavior.
- **Uncertainty Principle:** Werner Heisenberg showed that certain pairs of observables, like position and momentum, cannot both be precisely known simultaneously.
- **Superposition:** Quantum states can exist in combinations until observed or measured, enabling phenomena like quantum tunneling and entanglement.
- **Entanglement:** Particles can share states instantly across distance, forming the basis of quantum information science.

## Applications
- **Quantum Computing:** Qubits leverage superposition and entanglement to perform computations beyond classical reach.
- **Quantum Cryptography:** Protocols such as BB84 use quantum states to detect eavesdropping and secure communication.
- **Quantum Sensing:** Devices use quantum coherence for ultra-precise measurement of time, gravity, and magnetic fields.

Quantum mechanics underpins technologies from semiconductors to lasers and continues to shape emerging fields like quantum biology and quantum networks.
