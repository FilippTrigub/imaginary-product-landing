# Quantum Physics — Web Roundup Summary (Feb 16, 2026)

## Core principles
- **Wave–particle duality**: Particles (electrons, photons) behave as both waves and particles, demonstrated by interference in the double‑slit experiment.
- **Superposition**: Quantum systems can exist in multiple states until measured.
- **Entanglement**: Linked particles show correlated states over distance; measuring one affects the other.
- **Uncertainty principle**: Certain property pairs (e.g., position and momentum) can’t be precisely known at the same time.
- **Quantization**: Energy levels are discrete; transitions emit or absorb specific photons.

## Recent developments (2025)
- **Quantum computing**: Progress toward error‑corrected logical qubits and higher‑fidelity gate operations; continued demonstrations of quantum advantage in specialized simulations.
- **Quantum networking**: Prototype quantum repeaters and expanded quantum key distribution (QKD) deployments for secure communications.
- **Quantum sensing**: Improved precision for gravitational wave detection, nanoscale imaging, and ultra‑sensitive magnetic field measurements.
- **Quantum materials**: Advances in topological states (e.g., Majorana modes) toward more stable qubits.
- **Theory**: New quantum error‑correction insights and links between information theory and fundamental physics.
