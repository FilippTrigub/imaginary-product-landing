## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at the most fundamental level — the realm of atoms, electrons, and photons. At these tiny scales, the familiar rules of classical physics break down and are replaced by a set of counterintuitive but experimentally verified principles.

## Core Principles

### 1. Superposition

Particles can exist in **multiple states simultaneously** until they are observed or measured. This is the foundation of quantum computing's power — a qubit can be both 0 and 1 at the same time.

### 2. Entanglement

Two particles can become linked ("entangled") such that measuring one **instantly determines** the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."

### 3. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle

It is fundamentally impossible to know both the **exact position and exact momentum** of a particle at the same time. Uncertainty is not a limitation of our instruments — it is woven into the fabric of reality.

### 4. Wave-Particle Duality

Matter and light exhibit properties of **both waves and particles**, depending on how they are observed. The famous double-slit experiment demonstrates this beautifully.

### 5. Quantization

Energy is not continuous — it comes in discrete packets called **quanta**. This discovery by Max Planck in 1900 gave the field its name.

## Three Pillars of Quantum Technology (2025–2026)

| Discipline | Description |
|---|---|
| **Quantum Computation** | Using quantum processors to solve problems intractable for classical computers |
| **Quantum Communication** | Securing data transmission via quantum key distribution (QKD) |
| **Quantum Sensing** | Ultra-precise measurement technologies leveraging quantum effects |

## The International Year of Quantum (2025)

The United Nations declared **2025** as the **International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQ)**, marking 100 years since the foundational developments of quantum mechanics in 1925. This milestone has accelerated global investment, education, and public awareness of the quantum revolution.

## Real-World Applications Today

Quantum physics is not just theoretical — it already powers:

- **Lasers & transistors** — the backbone of modern electronics
- **Medical imaging** — MRI machines rely on quantum spin properties
- **GPS systems** — atomic clocks use quantum transitions for precision timing
- **Emerging quantum computers** — IBM, Google, and others are racing toward practical quantum advantage
- **Advanced cryptography** — quantum-safe encryption is being developed to counter future threats

## Looking Ahead: 2026 and Beyond

- Companies are pushing toward **practical quantum advantage** in drug discovery, finance, and logistics
- **Quantum error correction** is a major active research frontier
- Growing demand for a **quantum-literate workforce**
- Potential breakthroughs in our understanding of **gravity, spacetime, and the unification of physics**
