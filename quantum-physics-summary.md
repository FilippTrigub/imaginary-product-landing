# Quantum Physics — A Summary

> Compiled from web research on February 9, 2026.

## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at the most fundamental level. It examines the properties and behaviors of nature's basic building blocks — particles like electrons and photons — though quantum phenomena actually operate at every scale around us.

## Core Principles

### 1. Quantization of Energy

Energy doesn't flow continuously but arrives in discrete packets called **quanta**. This revolutionary idea, introduced by Max Planck in 1900, means that energy values are "stepped" rather than smooth — like a staircase rather than a ramp.

### 2. Wave-Particle Duality

Matter exhibits properties of both **particles** and **waves** simultaneously. Light, for instance, can behave as a wave (producing interference patterns) and as discrete particles (photons), depending on how it is observed.

### 3. Superposition

A quantum system can exist in **multiple states at once** until it is measured. Only upon observation does the system "collapse" into a single definite state. This is one of the most counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics.

### 4. Quantum Entanglement

Two particles can become linked such that measuring one **instantly affects** the other, regardless of the distance separating them. Einstein famously called this *"spooky action at a distance."*

### 5. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle

There are fundamental limits to what we can know. You cannot simultaneously measure certain pairs of properties — such as **position and momentum** — with absolute precision. Uncertainty is built into the fabric of reality itself.

## Modern Understanding

Our understanding has evolved from picturing electrons as tiny planets orbiting a nucleus to describing them as **probability distributions** within orbitals — mathematical descriptions of where electrons are *likely* to be found.

## Real-World Applications

Quantum physics is far from purely theoretical. It underpins:

| Technology | Quantum Basis |
|---|---|
| **Lasers** | Stimulated emission of photons |
| **Transistors & Chips** | Quantum behavior of semiconductors |
| **MRI Machines** | Nuclear magnetic resonance |
| **Quantum Computers** | Superposition & entanglement for computation |

Without quantum physics, we wouldn't have the technological infrastructure of modern life — from smartphones to medical imaging.

## Looking Forward

Quantum science is actively transforming our understanding of gravity, space, and time. Researchers are exploring how quantum principles might reveal connections between everything in the universe through higher dimensions. The field continues to close gaps across materials science, chemistry, biology, and astronomy, making it one of the most dynamic areas of modern physics.
