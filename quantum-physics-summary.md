## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics is the branch of physics that studies matter and energy at the **atomic and subatomic scale**. At this scale, particles behave dramatically differently from everyday objects — they can exist in multiple states simultaneously, become instantaneously connected across vast distances, and act as both particles and waves.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Wave-Particle Duality** | Matter and light exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. Einstein's 1905 photoelectric effect explanation demonstrated light consists of discrete packets called *photons*. |
| **Superposition** | Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured — enabling quantum systems to process information in fundamentally new ways. |
| **Entanglement** | Particles can become connected such that measuring one instantly affects another, regardless of distance — Einstein's "spooky action at a distance." |
| **Uncertainty Principle** | We cannot know both a particle's position and momentum precisely at the same time — a fundamental limit of nature, not technology. |

## Brief History

- **1900** — Max Planck discovered energy quantization ("quanta").
- **1905** — Albert Einstein explained the photoelectric effect (Nobel Prize, 1921).
- **1925–1926** — Heisenberg and Schrödinger formalized quantum mechanics.
- **2025** — United Nations declared the **International Year of Quantum Science and Technology**.

## Key Challenges in 2026

1. **Quantum Coherence** — maintaining delicate quantum states long enough for computation.
2. **Error Correction** — developing robust methods to correct quantum errors.
3. **Scalability** — building systems beyond hundreds of qubits to millions.
4. **Temperature** — many systems require near-absolute-zero conditions.

## Why It Matters

Without quantum physics, modern civilization wouldn't have computers, smartphones, laser technology, medical imaging, solar panels, or nuclear energy. The field now drives a technological revolution worth billions, with practical applications emerging across medicine, cryptography, and computing.
