# Quantum Physics: A Brief Summary

## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics is the branch of science that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales — atoms, electrons, and photons. Unlike classical physics, quantum mechanics follows a set of counterintuitive rules that have been repeatedly confirmed by experiment.

## Key Principles

- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Matter and light exhibit properties of both waves and particles. Einstein demonstrated this in 1905 when explaining the photoelectric effect.
- **Superposition**: A quantum particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured, at which point it "collapses" into a single state.
- **Entanglement**: Two particles can become linked so that measuring one instantly influences the other, regardless of distance — what Einstein called "spooky action at a distance."
- **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: Certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot both be precisely known at the same time. This is a fundamental limit of nature, not a limitation of measurement tools.
- **Quantization of Energy**: Energy exists in discrete packets ("quanta") rather than as a continuous spectrum, as first proposed by Max Planck in 1900.

## Brief History

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1900 | Max Planck introduces the concept of energy quanta |
| 1905 | Albert Einstein explains the photoelectric effect |
| 1925–27 | Schrödinger and Heisenberg develop formal quantum mechanics |
| 1935 | Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen describe quantum entanglement |
