## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics (quantum mechanics) is the branch of physics describing the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales. Developed in the early 20th century by pioneers like **Max Planck**, **Albert Einstein**, **Niels Bohr**, **Werner Heisenberg**, and **Erwin Schrödinger**, it revealed that classical Newtonian physics breaks down at the smallest scales.

## Fundamental Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Wave-Particle Duality** | Particles like electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior (de Broglie, 1924: λ = h/p). |
| **Quantization of Energy** | Energy comes in discrete packets called *quanta* (Planck, 1900: E = hν). |
| **Superposition** | A quantum system exists in multiple states simultaneously until measured (Schrödinger's cat). |
| **Uncertainty Principle** | Certain pairs of properties (e.g., position & momentum) cannot both be known precisely: Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2 (Heisenberg, 1927). |
| **Entanglement** | Particles become linked so that measuring one instantly affects the other, regardless of distance — "spooky action at a distance" (Einstein). |
| **Quantum Tunneling** | Particles can pass through energy barriers they classically shouldn't, enabling nuclear fusion in stars and flash memory. |

The governing equation is the **Schrödinger equation**: `iħ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ`.

## Key Interpretations

- **Copenhagen Interpretation** — Wave function collapses upon measurement; reality is fundamentally probabilistic.
- **Many-Worlds Interpretation** — All outcomes occur in branching parallel universes; no collapse.
- **Pilot-Wave Theory (de Broglie-Bohm)** — Particles are guided by hidden waves; deterministic but nonlocal.

## Real-World Applications

- **Electronics** — Transistors and semiconductors rely on quantum tunneling and band theory.
- **Quantum Computing** — Qubits leverage superposition and entanglement for exponential speedup.
- **Cryptography** — Quantum key distribution (e.g., BB84 protocol) enables theoretically unbreakable encryption.
- **Medical Imaging** — MRI machines and quantum sensors achieve unprecedented precision.
- **Lasers** — Stimulated emission of photons, a purely quantum phenomenon.

## Recent Developments (2025–2026)

| Area | Milestone |
|---|---|
| **Quantum Computing** | IBM and Google scaled to 100+ error-corrected logical qubits (2025). China's Jiuzhang 3.0 achieved quantum advantage in boson sampling (early 2026). |
| **Quantum Networks** | EU demonstrated entanglement distribution over 100 km of fiber (2025). DARPA linked satellites with ground stations for hack-proof data transfer (2026). |
| **Topological Quantum Matter** | Majorana fermions confirmed in iron-based superconductors (Microsoft, 2025), leading to anyon-based computing prototypes (2026). |
| **Quantum Sensing** | NV-center diamonds detected gravitational waves at room temperature (2025). Portable quantum magnetometers improved brain scan resolution 10× (2026). |
| **Foundational Physics** | Black hole information paradox resolution via holographic duality (2025). Wormhole simulations on quantum processors tested the ER=EPR conjecture. |

## Challenges Ahead

- **Decoherence** remains the primary barrier to scaling quantum computers.
- **Post-quantum cryptography** standards (finalized by NIST, 2024–2025) are critical as quantum decryption threatens current RSA encryption.
- Bridging **quantum mechanics with general relativity** remains an open frontier.
