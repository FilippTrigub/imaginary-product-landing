# Quantum Physics: A Brief Summary

Quantum physics is the fundamental theory describing the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scale. It underpins modern technologies such as lasers, transistors, and quantum computers.

## Key Concepts

### Wave-Particle Duality
Quantum objects like photons and electrons exhibit properties of both waves and particles, depending on how they are measured. The famous **double-slit experiment** demonstrates this: particles create interference patterns like waves, yet are detected as individual particles.

### Superposition
A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured. This principle is the foundation of **qubits** in quantum computing, which can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time, unlike classical bits.

### Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
There is a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) can be known simultaneously. The act of measurement itself disturbs the quantum state of the object being observed.

### Quantum Entanglement
When two particles interact in the right way, their states become correlated regardless of the distance separating them. Measuring one particle instantaneously determines the state of the other. This phenomenon enables technologies like **quantum key distribution (QKD)** for secure communication.

### Spin
Spin is an intrinsic property of elementary particles, similar to mass or charge. It determines how particles interact and is responsible for giving matter its volume — electrons cannot occupy the same space due to their spin (Pauli exclusion principle).

## Why It Matters

Quantum physics closes gaps in classical physics and provides the foundation for emerging technologies including quantum computing, quantum networking, quantum cryptography, and ultra-precise sensors. Its predictions have been verified experimentally to extraordinary accuracy — quantum electrodynamics agrees with experiment to within 1 part in 10^12.
