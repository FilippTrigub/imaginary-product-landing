## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics (quantum mechanics) is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales — atoms, subatomic particles, and photons. It replaced classical Newtonian mechanics at these scales, revealing a fundamentally probabilistic and non-local universe.

## Core Principles

### 1. Quantization
Energy, momentum, and angular momentum come in discrete units. Electrons occupy specific energy levels, not continuous ones.

### 2. Superposition
A quantum system can exist in **multiple states simultaneously** until measured. (Schrödinger's cat: both alive and dead until observed.)

### 3. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
You cannot precisely know both position and momentum of a particle at the same time:

```
Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ / 2
```

This is not a measurement limitation — it is an inherent property of nature.

### 4. Wave-Particle Duality
All particles exhibit both wave and particle behaviors. The double-slit experiment demonstrates electrons creating interference patterns (wave) yet being detected as discrete hits (particle).

### 5. Entanglement
Linked particles share a quantum state. Measuring one **instantly** affects the other, regardless of distance — what Einstein called "spooky action at a distance."

### 6. Pauli Exclusion Principle
No two fermions (e.g., electrons) can occupy the same quantum state. This explains atomic structure and the periodic table.

### 7. Decoherence
Interaction with the environment causes superpositions to collapse into classical outcomes, bridging the quantum and classical worlds.
