# Quantum Physics: A Summary

> Compiled from web research — February 9, 2026

## What is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at the most fundamental level. It examines the behavior of atoms, electrons, photons, and other subatomic particles — the very building blocks of nature.

## Core Principles

### 1. Quantization of Energy

Energy exists only at discrete "quantized" values. Max Planck proposed in 1900 that energy comes in tiny packets called **quanta** — like a coffee being exactly 120°F or 125°F, but never anything in between.

### 2. Wave-Particle Duality

Matter and energy exhibit properties of both particles and waves. Einstein's 1905 explanation of the photoelectric effect demonstrated that light itself consists of particles called **photons**.

### 3. Superposition

Particles can exist in **multiple states simultaneously** until they are measured. This is one of the most counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics and forms the basis for quantum computing.

### 4. Quantum Entanglement

Two particles can be linked so that measuring one **instantly affects the other**, regardless of the distance between them. Einstein famously called this *"spooky action at a distance."*

### 5. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle

There are fundamental limits to what we can know. You **cannot simultaneously measure** certain pairs of properties (like position and momentum) with absolute precision.

## Modern Applications (2025–2026)

| Application | Description |
|---|---|
| **Quantum Computers** | Leverage superposition and entanglement for unprecedented computing power |
| **Quantum Sensors** | Ultra-precise measurement devices for scientific and industrial use |
| **Data Encryption** | Quantum-based security systems (quantum key distribution) |
| **Advanced Light Sources** | New laser and photonic technologies |

The British government recently committed **£270 million** to quantum technology research, underscoring the field's growing strategic importance.

## Why It Matters

Quantum physics is the foundation of modern technology — from lasers and transistors to MRI machines and smartphones. As we move through 2025–2026, quantum science continues to transform our understanding of reality, with potential breakthroughs in computing, cryptography, and materials science.
