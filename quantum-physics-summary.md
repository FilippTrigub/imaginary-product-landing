## Core Fundamentals

Quantum physics describes the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales. Its key principles include:

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Wave-Particle Duality** | Particles like electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, as demonstrated by the double-slit experiment. |
| **Superposition** | Quantum systems exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured — famously illustrated by Schrödinger's cat. |
| **Entanglement** | Particles become linked so that measuring one instantly affects the other, regardless of distance — Einstein's "spooky action at a distance." |
| **Uncertainty Principle** | Heisenberg's 1927 principle: certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot both be precisely known at the same time. |
| **Quantization** | Energy levels are discrete, not continuous — electrons occupy specific orbits, explaining atomic spectra. |

These principles underpin technologies like **semiconductors**, **lasers**, and **MRI machines**, and are mathematically described by the **Schrödinger equation**.
