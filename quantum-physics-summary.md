# Quantum Physics: A Summary

## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at their most fundamental level. It examines the behavior of nature's building blocks — atoms, electrons, and photons — revealing how the universe operates at the smallest scales.

The field emerged in the early 1900s when **Max Planck** proposed that energy is emitted in discrete packets called *quanta*. **Albert Einstein** expanded on this by explaining the photoelectric effect, demonstrating that light itself consists of particles (photons).

## Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Superposition** | Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. |
| **Entanglement** | Two particles can be linked so that measuring one instantly affects the other, regardless of distance. |
| **Uncertainty Principle** | Certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot both be measured with absolute precision. |
| **Wave-Particle Duality** | Matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves. |
| **Quantization** | Energy exists only at discrete, "quantized" values — not as a continuous spectrum. |

## Real-World Applications

Quantum physics already powers many everyday technologies:

- **Lasers and LEDs** — used in communications, medicine, and displays
- **Solar cells** — converting light into electricity via the photoelectric effect
- **MRI scanners** — medical imaging based on quantum spin properties
- **GPS systems** — relying on atomic clocks governed by quantum mechanics
- **Transistors and computer chips** — the backbone of all modern electronics

## Emerging Technologies (2025–2026)

**Quantum Computing** is the most anticipated frontier. Unlike classical computers that process calculations sequentially, quantum computers leverage superposition and entanglement to solve multiple calculations simultaneously. Potential breakthroughs include:

- Drug discovery and cancer diagnosis
- Cryptography and cybersecurity
- Complex optimization problems (logistics, finance, climate modeling)

## 2025: International Year of Quantum

The **United Nations proclaimed 2025** as the *International Year of Quantum Science and Technology*, marking 100 years since the initial development of quantum mechanics. This recognition highlights quantum's growing importance in science and society.

## Looking Forward

Quantum science continues to push the boundaries of our understanding — from the nature of gravity and spacetime to how everything in the universe may be interconnected. The field remains at the forefront of scientific innovation, promising technologies that were once purely speculative.
