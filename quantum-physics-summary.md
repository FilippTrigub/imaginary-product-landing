## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics (quantum mechanics) is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales. It replaced classical Newtonian mechanics for phenomena involving probabilities, wave-particle duality, and fundamental uncertainty.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Wave-Particle Duality** | Particles like electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior (e.g., double-slit experiment, photoelectric effect). |
| **Superposition** | A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. Described by the wave function ψ. |
| **Quantum Entanglement** | Particles can become linked so the state of one instantly influences the other, regardless of distance — "spooky action at a distance." |
| **Uncertainty Principle** | Heisenberg (1927): certain pairs of properties (e.g., position & momentum) cannot both be known precisely: `Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ/2`. |
| **Quantization** | Energy levels in atoms are discrete, not continuous. Introduced by Max Planck in 1900. |

The mathematical backbone is the **Schrödinger equation**:

```
iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Hψ
```

where `H` is the Hamiltonian operator governing time evolution of quantum states.
