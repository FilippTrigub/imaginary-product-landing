# Quantum Physics — Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics (quantum mechanics) describes how matter and energy behave at atomic and subatomic scales where classical physics breaks down. It introduces probabilistic behavior, wave-like properties of particles, and measurement effects that are absent in classical mechanics.

## Core Concepts
- **Wave–Particle Duality**: Particles such as electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior, depending on how they are measured.
- **Superposition**: A quantum system can exist in multiple states at once until measurement collapses it into a single outcome.
- **Entanglement**: Two or more particles can share linked quantum states so that measuring one instantly constrains the state of the other, even at large distances.
- **Uncertainty Principle**: Certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot both be precisely known at the same time, setting fundamental limits on measurement.
- **Quantum Tunneling**: Particles can pass through energy barriers that would be impossible under classical physics, enabling effects like nuclear fusion and some electronic behaviors.

## Why It Matters
Quantum physics underpins modern technologies such as semiconductors, lasers, MRI, and the emerging fields of quantum computing and quantum cryptography. It also drives research into new materials, precision sensing, and secure communication systems.
