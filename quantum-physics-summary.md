# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics studies matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales, where behavior differs from classical expectations. Foundational principles include quantization of energy, wave-particle duality, and probabilistic measurement outcomes.

## Key Concepts
- **Superposition:** Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.
- **Entanglement:** Correlated particles share linked states across distance, enabling non-classical correlations.
- **Uncertainty Principle:** Certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot be measured precisely at the same time.
- **Wave-Particle Duality:** Matter and light display both wave-like and particle-like characteristics.

## Why It Matters
Quantum theory underpins modern technologies such as lasers, semiconductors, MRI, and emerging quantum computing and cryptography. Ongoing research focuses on improving coherence, error correction, and scalable hardware to bring practical quantum applications to reality.
