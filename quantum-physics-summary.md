## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics (quantum mechanics) is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales — atoms, electrons, and photons. Developed in the early 20th century, it replaced classical Newtonian mechanics at subatomic scales with a probabilistic, wave-based framework.

## Core Principles

### Wave-Particle Duality
Particles such as electrons and photons exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behavior. The **double-slit experiment** famously demonstrates this: particles create interference patterns (waves) yet arrive as discrete hits (particles).

### Superposition
A quantum system can exist in **multiple states simultaneously** until it is measured. Schrödinger's cat is the classic thought experiment — the cat is both alive and dead until the box is opened. Mathematically, this is encoded in the **wave function ψ**.

### Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
Certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot both be known precisely at the same time:

```
Δx · Δp ≥ ħ/2
```

This is not a measurement limitation — it is a fundamental property of nature.

### Quantization
Energy levels in atoms are **discrete**, not continuous. Electrons occupy specific shells, which explains atomic emission spectra (e.g., the characteristic glow of neon).

### Entanglement
When particles interact, their quantum states become correlated. Measuring one particle **instantly** determines the state of the other, regardless of distance — what Einstein called "spooky action at a distance." Bell's inequalities and Alain Aspect's 1982 experiments confirmed this phenomenon.

## Mathematical Foundations

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Wave Function (ψ)** | Encodes probability distributions; \|ψ\|² gives the likelihood of a measurement outcome. |
| **Schrödinger Equation** | `iħ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ` — governs how quantum states evolve over time. |
| **Operators & Observables** | Physical quantities are represented by operators; measurement collapses ψ to an eigenvalue. |

| 1940s | Quantum electrodynamics (QED) by Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga. |
| 1982 | Aspect's experiments confirm entanglement and violate Bell's inequalities. |

## Open Challenges

- **Decoherence** — quantum states are fragile and easily disrupted by the environment.
- **Scalability** — building fault-tolerant, million-qubit machines remains an engineering frontier.
- **Gravity** — quantum mechanics describes three of four fundamental forces; integrating gravity (quantum gravity) is unsolved.
- **Interpretation** — debates continue between Copenhagen, many-worlds, and other interpretations of what quantum mechanics "means."
