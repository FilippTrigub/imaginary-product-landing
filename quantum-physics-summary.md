# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics (quantum mechanics) studies matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales. At these scales, classical physics breaks down and particles behave in probabilistic, wave-like ways that defy everyday intuition.

## Core Concepts
- **Superposition:** A quantum system can exist in multiple states at the same time until it is measured. This idea underpins qubits in quantum computing.
- **Entanglement:** Two or more particles can share linked states, so measuring one instantly influences the other, regardless of distance.
- **Uncertainty Principle:** Certain properties, such as position and momentum, cannot both be known with arbitrary precision at the same time.
- **Wave–Particle Duality:** Particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior, depending on how they are observed.

## Why It Matters
Quantum physics explains fundamental phenomena such as blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect, and it enables technologies like lasers, MRI, and emerging quantum computing and cryptography systems.
