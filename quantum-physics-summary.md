# Quantum Physics — A Summary

> Compiled on February 9, 2026, from web research.

## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at the most fundamental level. It examines the properties and behaviors of nature's basic building blocks — atoms, electrons, photons, and other subatomic particles. While many experiments focus on very small objects, quantum phenomena actually occur at every scale around us.

## Core Principles

### 1. Quantization of Energy

Around 1900, physicist **Max Planck** discovered that energy isn't continuous but comes in discrete packets called **quanta**. This was revolutionary — reality itself is "quantized."

### 2. Wave-Particle Duality

Light and matter exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect (1905) demonstrated that light consists of particles called **photons**, earning him the Nobel Prize in 1921.

### 3. Quantum Superposition

Particles can exist in **multiple states simultaneously** until measured. The famous "Schrödinger's cat" thought experiment illustrates this principle — a cat in a box is both alive and dead until observed.

### 4. Quantum Entanglement

Einstein called this **"spooky action at a distance"** — particles can be instantaneously connected regardless of the distance separating them. Measuring one particle immediately affects its entangled partner.

## Real-World Applications

Quantum physics underpins much of modern technology:

- **Quantum Computing** — moving from theory to practical devices
- **Data Encryption** — quantum key distribution for unbreakable security
- **Quantum Sensing** — ultra-precise measurements for navigation and medicine
- **Everyday Tech** — computers, smartphones, lasers, MRI machines, and micro-circuitry

## 2025: International Year of Quantum Science

The United Nations proclaimed 2025 the **International Year of Quantum Science and Technology**, marking 100 years of quantum progress since the foundational work of the 1920s. Key areas of focus include:

1. Discovery science
2. Computing and communication
3. Finance and medicine
4. Navigation and logistics

## Key Research Areas (2025–2026)

| Area | Description |
|---|---|
| Quantum Computers | Building practical, scalable quantum hardware |
| Quantum Algorithms | Developing new computational methods (e.g., Shor's, Grover's) |
| Error Correction | Essential for reliable, fault-tolerant quantum technologies |
| Quantum Sensing | Ultra-precise measurements beyond classical limits |
| Quantum Simulation | Modeling complex quantum systems for materials science and chemistry |

## Why It Matters

Without quantum physics, we wouldn't have smartphones, computers, lasers, or numerous medical technologies. The field continues to expand our understanding of reality itself, potentially revolutionizing computing, communication, and our fundamental understanding of the universe.
