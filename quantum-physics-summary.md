## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales — atoms, photons, and subatomic particles. It underpins much of modern technology, from transistors to lasers, and is now driving a **second quantum revolution** in computing, communication, and sensing.

### Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Wave-Particle Duality** | Quantum entities behave as both particles and waves depending on observation. |
| **Superposition** | A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. |
| **Entanglement** | Two particles can be correlated such that measuring one instantly determines the state of the other, regardless of distance. |
| **Uncertainty Principle** | Certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot both be precisely known at the same time. |

## Breakthrough Discoveries (2025–2026)

### 1. Hidden Quantum Geometry in Materials (Feb 2026)
Scientists discovered a hidden quantum geometry inside materials that subtly steers electrons — similar to how gravity warps light in space. This effect, previously only theoretical, has now been observed experimentally, opening new avenues for understanding electron behavior in quantum materials.

### 2. "Negative Time" in Atom-Photon Interactions (2025)
Aephraim Steinberg's team at the University of Toronto observed **"negative time"** when measuring how long photons spend in excited atomic states of ultracold rubidium atoms. While this doesn't imply time travel, it reveals deeply counterintuitive aspects of quantum measurement.

### 3. Quantum Effects at Macroscopic Scales (Jan 2026)
Researchers at the University of Vienna demonstrated quantum superposition in **metallic nanoparticles the size of viruses** — the most macroscopic objects ever to exhibit Schrödinger's cat-like behavior. This pushes the boundary between the quantum and classical worlds closer to everyday reality.

### 4. Entangled Atoms as Precision Sensors (Jan 2026)
The University of Basel and Laboratoire Kastler Brossel showed that quantum entanglement between spatially separated atomic clouds can measure electromagnetic fields with **unprecedented precision**, surpassing traditional methods.

## Emerging Quantum Technologies

- **Quantum Computing**: QNodeOS, the first operating system for quantum networks, was developed at Delft University, making quantum computing infrastructure more practical.
- **Quantum Communication**: Quantum structured light can dramatically increase information capacity per photon. Chip-based quantum memory using 3D-printed "light cages" enables reliable storage of quantum information.
- **Quantum Sensing**: Phonon lasers generating microscopic vibrations on microchips could transform future electronics. Enhanced atomic clocks and gravity sensors leverage entanglement for extreme accuracy.
- **Dark Matter Research**: Quantum simulations are being used to study self-interacting dark matter, with ultra-sensitive detectors designed to spot particle interactions that might occur only once in years.

## The Two Quantum Revolutions

| Era | Key Outcomes |
|---|---|
| **First Revolution** (20th century) | Transistors, semiconductors, microchips, lasers, LEDs, GPS, atomic clocks |
| **Second Revolution** (now) | Quantum computers, unbreakable quantum communication, revolutionary sensors, quantum internet |

As physicist Jim Al-Khalili notes, we are firmly in the second quantum revolution — one that promises to fundamentally reshape technology, communication, and our understanding of reality.
