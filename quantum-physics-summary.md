# Quantum Physics: A Brief Summary

Quantum mechanics is the fundamental physical theory describing the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scale. It underpins all of quantum physics, including quantum chemistry, quantum computing, and quantum information science.

## Key Concepts

### Wave-Particle Duality
Quantum objects exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. The famous **double-slit experiment** demonstrates this: particles such as electrons create interference patterns (a wave property) when unobserved, yet behave as discrete particles when measured.

### Superposition
A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until a measurement is performed, at which point the **wave function collapses** to a single definite state. This principle is the foundation of qubits in quantum computing.

### The Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that certain pairs of properties — such as position and momentum — cannot both be known with arbitrary precision at the same time. This is not a limitation of instruments but a fundamental property of nature.

### Quantum Entanglement
When two particles become entangled, the state of one instantly influences the state of the other regardless of the distance between them. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance." Entanglement is key to quantum key distribution (QKD) and secure communication.

### Quantum Tunneling
Particles can pass through potential energy barriers that would be insurmountable in classical physics. This effect is essential to technologies like the scanning tunneling microscope.

## Recent Developments (early 2026)

- **Hidden quantum geometry** discovered inside materials that steers electrons similarly to how gravity warps light.
- **Phonon lasers** engineered on microchips, with potential to shrink future electronics.
- Breakthroughs in **quantum structured light** that increase the information capacity of single photons for secure communication.
- Advances in **chip-based quantum memory** using nanoprinted light cages, pushing toward a practical quantum internet.
- New theories unifying **competing models of exotic particle behavior** inside quantum matter.
