## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics (or quantum mechanics) is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales — atoms, electrons, photons, and subatomic particles. Developed in the early 20th century, it revealed that classical physics breaks down at the quantum level.

## Core Principles

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
Particles like electrons and photons exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties. The famous **double-slit experiment** demonstrates this: light creates interference patterns (wave behavior) but is detected as discrete particles.

### 2. Quantization
Energy comes in discrete packets called **quanta**. Electrons in atoms occupy specific energy levels, as described by Bohr's model and refined by Schrödinger's wave equation.

### 3. Superposition
A quantum system can exist in **multiple states simultaneously** until measured. This is the basis of quantum computing, where qubits hold both 0 and 1 at once.

### 4. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
Certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot both be known precisely at the same time:

```
Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ/2
```

### 5. Entanglement
Particles can become linked so that the state of one **instantly influences** the other, regardless of distance — what Einstein called "spooky action at a distance." This earned the 2022 Nobel Prize for Aspect, Clauser, and Zeilinger.

## Recent Developments (2025–2026)

- **IBM** unveiled its **1,121-qubit Condor processor**, pushing toward fault-tolerant quantum systems.
- **Google's Sycamore** achieved a milestone in quantum error correction, reducing noise by ~50%.
- **Quantum Networks**: The European Quantum Internet Alliance demonstrated entanglement over 100 km via fiber optics. The U.S. funded a **$1.2 billion** national quantum network project.
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: NIST published new standards in early 2026 to defend against quantum attacks on current encryption (e.g., RSA).
- **Global Investment**: Quantum technology investment hit **$40 billion** in 2025, with Asia leading in hardware and Europe in software.

## Challenges Ahead

- **Decoherence**: Quantum states are fragile and easily disrupted by environmental noise.
- **Error Correction**: Scaling to millions of stable qubits remains an engineering challenge.
- **Encryption Risk**: Quantum computers may eventually break widely-used encryption schemes.
