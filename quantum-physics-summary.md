# Quantum Physics: A Summary

## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics is the branch of science that studies matter and energy at their most fundamental level — the behavior of atoms, electrons, photons, and other subatomic particles. Unlike classical physics, quantum mechanics reveals a world governed by probability, duality, and deep interconnection.

> *"If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics."* — Richard Feynman

## Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Superposition** | Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. |
| **Entanglement** | Two particles can be linked such that measuring one instantly affects the other, regardless of distance. |
| **Uncertainty Principle** | Certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot both be known with perfect precision. |
| **Wave-Particle Duality** | Matter and light exhibit properties of both waves and particles. |
| **Quantized Energy** | Energy exists in discrete packets ("quanta"), not as a continuous spectrum. |
