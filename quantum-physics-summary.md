# Quantum Physics — A Summary

## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics (or quantum mechanics) is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales — atoms, subatomic particles, and photons. It replaces the deterministic worldview of classical (Newtonian) mechanics with one governed by **probability**, **superposition**, and **entanglement**.

## Core Principles

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
Particles such as electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on how they are observed. Key experiments include the **double-slit experiment** and Einstein's explanation of the **photoelectric effect** (1905).

### 2. Quantization of Energy
Energy is not continuous — it comes in discrete packets called **quanta**. Max Planck introduced this idea in 1900. Electrons in atoms occupy specific energy levels, and transitions between them emit or absorb photons of precise wavelengths.

### 3. Superposition & the Uncertainty Principle
A quantum system can exist in **multiple states simultaneously** until measured (Schrödinger's wave equation, 1926). The **Heisenberg uncertainty principle** (1927) states that certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot both be known with arbitrary precision:

```
Δx · Δp ≥ ħ/2
```

### 4. Quantum Entanglement
Particles can become correlated so that the state of one **instantly influences** the other, regardless of distance — what Einstein called "spooky action at a distance." Confirmed experimentally via Bell's inequality tests in the 1980s.

### 5. Measurement & Wave Function Collapse
Observing a quantum system causes its wave function to "collapse" into a single definite state. The probability of each outcome is given by the **Born rule** (the square of the wave function's amplitude).

### The Schrödinger Equation

The mathematical backbone of quantum mechanics:

```
iħ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ
```

where **ψ** is the wave function and **Ĥ** is the Hamiltonian operator.

## Recent Developments (2025–2026)

| Area | Highlight |
|---|---|
| **Quantum Computing** | IBM & Google progressed toward fault-tolerant quantum computers with 1,000+ logical qubits and error rates below 0.1%. China's Jiuzhang 3.0 demonstrated supremacy in molecular simulations for drug discovery. |
| **Quantum Networking** | The EU's Quantum Internet Alliance piloted entanglement distribution over 100 km fiber. Japan achieved satellite-based QKD with < 1% error rates. |
| **Quantum Sensing** | Entangled atomic clocks detected gravitational waves from neutron star mergers. Diamond NV-center sensors enabled nanoscale brain imaging. |
| **Theory** | New "quantum gravity" frameworks (loop quantum gravity) were tested via black hole simulations. CERN experiments hinted at Lorentz invariance violations at quantum scales. |
| **Applications** | Quantum ML algorithms outperformed classical AI in climate modeling. Room-temperature qubits using topological materials (Majorana fermions) were prototyped. |

## Key Challenges

- **Decoherence** — quantum states are fragile and easily disrupted by environmental noise.
- **Scalability** — building large-scale, error-corrected quantum systems remains difficult.
- **Theory gaps** — fully reconciling quantum mechanics with general relativity is still an open problem.
