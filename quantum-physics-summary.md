# Quantum Physics: A Summary

## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics (quantum mechanics) is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales — atoms, subatomic particles, and photons. Developed in the early 20th century, it revealed that reality at the quantum level defies classical intuition.

## Historical Foundations

| Year | Milestone | Contributor |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1900 | Energy quantization (quanta) | Max Planck |
| 1905 | Photoelectric effect (light as photons) | Albert Einstein |
| 1913 | Quantized atomic model | Niels Bohr |
| 1925 | Matrix mechanics | Werner Heisenberg |
| 1926 | Wave mechanics (Schrödinger equation) | Erwin Schrödinger |
| 1927 | Uncertainty principle | Werner Heisenberg |
| 1957 | Many-Worlds interpretation | Hugh Everett |

## Core Principles

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
Particles like electrons exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties. The de Broglie relation connects them: **λ = h/p**, where *h* is Planck's constant and *p* is momentum.

### 2. Quantization
Energy levels in bound systems (e.g., electrons in atoms) are **discrete**, not continuous. This explains atomic spectra and why electrons don't spiral into the nucleus.

### 3. Superposition
A quantum system can exist in **multiple states simultaneously** until measured. Schrödinger's cat is the famous thought experiment illustrating this.

### 4. Uncertainty Principle
You cannot precisely know both position and momentum at the same time:

> **Δx · Δp ≥ ħ/2**

This is not a measurement limitation — it is fundamental to nature.

### 5. Entanglement
Particles can become linked so that measuring one **instantly affects the other**, regardless of distance. Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance." It has been experimentally verified many times since the 1980s.

## The Schrödinger Equation

The mathematical backbone of quantum mechanics:

> **iħ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ**

Where *ψ* is the wave function (describing probabilities) and *Ĥ* is the Hamiltonian operator for energy.

## Key Applications
