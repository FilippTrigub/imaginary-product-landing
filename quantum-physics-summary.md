# Quantum Physics: A Summary

> Research compiled on February 16, 2026

## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics (quantum mechanics) is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales. It revolutionized our understanding of the universe in the early 20th century and continues to drive breakthroughs in computing, communication, and materials science.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality

Particles like electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on how they are observed. This is captured by the **de Broglie wavelength**: `λ = h / p`, where *h* is Planck's constant and *p* is momentum.

### 2. Superposition

A quantum system can exist in **multiple states simultaneously** until it is measured, at which point it collapses into a single definite state. This is the principle behind Schrödinger's famous cat thought experiment and is governed by the **Schrödinger equation**:

```
iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ
```

### 3. Quantum Entanglement

Two particles can become linked so that measuring one **instantly determines** the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them — what Einstein called "spooky action at a distance." Bell's theorem confirms no local hidden variables can explain these correlations.

### 4. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle

There is a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) can be known simultaneously:

```
Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ/2
```

### 5. Quantization of Energy

Energy is not continuous — it comes in discrete packets called **quanta**. This explains atomic spectra, the photoelectric effect, and underpins technologies like quantum dots and LEDs.

### 6. Quantum Tunneling

Particles can pass through energy barriers they classically should not be able to surmount, due to the probabilistic nature of their wave functions. This effect is essential for flash memory, scanning tunneling microscopes, and emerging transistor designs.
