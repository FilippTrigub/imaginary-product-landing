## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics (or quantum mechanics) is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales — atoms, subatomic particles like electrons and photons, and their interactions. Unlike classical (Newtonian) physics, which governs macroscopic objects, quantum physics reveals a world driven by **probability**, **wave-particle duality**, and **inherent uncertainty**.

The theory emerged in the early 20th century to explain phenomena classical physics could not, such as the stability of atoms and the photoelectric effect.

## Fundamental Concepts

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
Particles such as electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. The famous **double-slit experiment** demonstrates this: electrons create an interference pattern even when fired one at a time.

### 2. Quantization
Energy is not continuous — it comes in discrete packets called **quanta**. Planck's constant (`h ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s`) sets the scale. Electrons in atoms occupy quantized energy levels.

### 3. Superposition
A quantum system can exist in **multiple states simultaneously** until it is measured. This is famously illustrated by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. The probability of each outcome is given by the **Born rule**: `P = |ψ|²`.

### 4. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
Certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot both be known precisely at the same time:

```
Δx · Δp ≥ ħ/2
```

This is not a limitation of instruments — it is a fundamental property of nature.

### 5. Quantum Entanglement
When particles interact, their quantum states can become linked. Measuring one particle **instantly** affects the other, regardless of distance. Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance." Experiments confirming Bell's theorem have validated entanglement since the 1980s.

### 6. The Schrödinger Equation
The central equation of quantum mechanics:

```
iħ ∂ψ/∂t = Hψ
```

It predicts how the wave function `ψ` evolves over time. For time-independent systems (e.g., the hydrogen atom), it yields discrete energy eigenvalues.
