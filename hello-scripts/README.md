# Hello Scripts

This folder contains simple "Hello, World!" scripts in multiple languages.

Usage:
- `./hello.sh` (bash)
- `./hello.js` (Node.js)
- `./hello.py` (Python)
- `hello.go` (Go source; run with `go run` if Go is installed)

Each script prints a small language-specific greeting to stdout.
