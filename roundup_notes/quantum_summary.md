# Quantum Physics Roundup

## Overview
Quantum mechanics describes how matter and electromagnetic radiation behave at atomic and subatomic scales. Instead of deterministic trajectories, systems evolve according to probabilistic wavefunctions governed by the Schrödinger equation. Measurement collapses these wavefunctions, producing discrete energy levels and other quantized observables.

## Key Principles
- **Wave-particle duality**: Particles such as electrons exhibit both wave-like interference and particle-like impacts.
- **Uncertainty principle**: Conjugate properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot both be known with arbitrary precision (Heisenberg limit).
- **Superposition and entanglement**: Quantum states can exist in linear combinations; entangled systems display correlations stronger than any classical model.
- **Quantization**: Many physical quantities, like energy in bound systems, appear in discrete spectra rather than continuous ranges.

## Applications
Quantum theory underpins semiconductors, lasers, atomic clocks, MRI, and modern cryptography research. Emerging quantum technologies aim to leverage coherent control for computing, secure communication, and sensing far beyond classical capabilities.
