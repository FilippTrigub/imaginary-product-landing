# Quantum Physics: A Comprehensive Summary

## 1. Basic Principles of Quantum Physics
Quantum physics (or quantum mechanics) is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales—typically atoms and subatomic particles. It departs from classical physics by introducing probabilistic rather than deterministic descriptions of physical systems.

Key principles:
- **Quantization**: Certain properties, such as energy and angular momentum, are quantized, meaning they can only take on discrete values.
- **Wave-particle duality**: Particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
- **Probabilistic nature**: The state of a system is described by a wavefunction, which provides probabilities for measurement outcomes.
- **Uncertainty**: Some pairs of physical properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision.

## 2. Key Historical Developments and Scientists
Quantum physics emerged in the early 20th century as classical physics failed to explain phenomena like blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect.

## 3. Fundamental Concepts

### Wave-Particle Duality
- Particles (e.g., electrons, photons) exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.
- Demonstrated by experiments like the **double-slit experiment**, where particles create interference patterns.
- The **de Broglie wavelength** (*λ = h/p*) relates a particle's momentum (*p*) to its wavelength (*λ*).

### Superposition
- A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.
- Described by a **wavefunction** (*ψ*), which is a linear combination of all possible states.
- Example: Schrödinger's cat—a thought experiment illustrating superposition (alive *and* dead until observed).

### Quantum Entanglement
- Two or more particles become correlated such that the state of one instantaneously influences the state of the other, regardless of distance.
- Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance."
- Basis for **quantum computing** and **quantum cryptography**.

### Uncertainty Principle
- Formulated by Werner Heisenberg.
- States that certain pairs of physical properties (e.g., position *x* and momentum *p*) cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision:
  **Δx · Δp ≥ h/4π**.
- Reflects the fundamental limit of knowledge in quantum systems.

## 4. Quantum Mechanics vs Classical Physics

| Aspect               | Classical Physics                          | Quantum Physics                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Determinism**      | Predictable, deterministic outcomes.       | Probabilistic outcomes (wavefunction collapse). |
| **Measurement**      | Measurement does not affect the system.    | Measurement collapses the wavefunction.        |
| **Continuity**       | Energy and properties vary continuously.   | Energy and properties are quantized.           |
| **Locality**         | Objects are influenced only by local interactions. | Non-locality (entanglement).              |
| **Scale**            | Applies to macroscopic objects.            | Applies to atomic and subatomic scales.        |
