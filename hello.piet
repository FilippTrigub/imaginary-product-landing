# This is a text representation of a Piet program
# Piet programs are actually images with colored pixels
# The actual program would be a PNG image with specific colored blocks
# This text representation describes what the image would contain

# Start with light red (push 1)
# Dark red (duplicate)
# Light yellow (push 4)
# Dark yellow (multiply - gives 4)
# Light green (duplicate)
# Dark green (add - gives 5)
# Continue with color transitions to build ASCII values for "Hello, World!"

# In reality, this would be a colorful pixel art image
# Each color transition performs a specific operation
# The program pointer follows the colored regions

Hello, World! in Piet requires a visual image file to run properly.
