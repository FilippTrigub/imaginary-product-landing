# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales. It describes phenomena that classical physics cannot explain, such as the discrete nature of energy, wave-particle duality, and quantum entanglement.

## Key Concepts

### Wave-Particle Duality
Objects at quantum scales exhibit properties of both waves and particles. This means:
- Electrons, photons, and other quantum particles can behave as waves (showing interference patterns)
- They can also behave as particles (having definite position and momentum)
- The behavior depends on how they are observed

### Quantization
Energy exists in discrete packets called **quanta**. Instead of continuous values, energy levels in atoms and molecules are quantized, meaning only specific energy values are allowed. This explains atomic spectra and the stability of atoms.

### Uncertainty Principle
Proposed by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the precise position and momentum of a quantum particle. The more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be known.

### Superposition
A quantum system can exist in a combination of multiple states simultaneously. A particle can be in multiple locations at once until it is observed. Upon measurement, the superposition "collapses" into a definite state.

### Quantum Entanglement
Two or more quantum particles can become entangled, meaning they share a quantum state. When one entangled particle is measured, the state of the other is instantly determined, regardless of distance. This phenomenon puzzled even Einstein.

## Applications

- **Electronics & Computing**: Transistors, semiconductors, and potentially quantum computers
- **Photonics**: Lasers, LEDs, and optical communication
- **Medicine**: PET scans and other diagnostic tools
- **Energy**: Solar cells and nuclear reactions

## Historical Development

- **Early 1900s**: Planck, Einstein, and Bohr developed initial quantum theory
- **1920s-1930s**: Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Dirac formalized quantum mechanics
- **Modern Era**: Continued development in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing

## Conclusion

Quantum physics represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of reality at the smallest scales. It has revolutionized technology and continues to be the foundation for modern physics and emerging quantum technologies.
