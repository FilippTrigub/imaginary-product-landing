# Quantum Mechanics Roundup

## Overview
Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that explains how matter and energy behave at atomic and subatomic scales. It departs from classical intuition by introducing quantized energy levels, wave-particle duality, and probabilistic outcomes governed by the wavefunction.

## Core Concepts
- **Wave-particle duality:** Particles exhibit both localized and wave-like behavior, leading to interference phenomena such as the Mach–Zehnder interferometer.
- **Uncertainty principle:** Certain pairs of observables—like position and momentum—cannot both be known precisely, captured by Heisenberg's relation.
- **Quantum states and evolution:** The Schrödinger equation governs how wavefunctions evolve over time, while measurements project states onto eigenvectors.
- **Entanglement:** Composite systems can share correlated states that remain linked regardless of spatial separation, enabling nonclassical correlations.

## Mathematical Foundations
Quantum mechanics can be formulated using wave mechanics, matrix mechanics, or path integrals, all of which rely on linear algebra, complex vector spaces, and operators to describe observables and symmetries.

## Applications
Quantum theory underpins semiconductors, lasers, magnetic resonance imaging, and emerging fields like quantum computing and secure communication.
