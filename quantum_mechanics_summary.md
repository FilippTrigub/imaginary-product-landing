# Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

Here are some key concepts:

* **Quantization:** Certain physical properties like energy can only take on discrete values.
* **Wave-particle duality:** Light and matter exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
* **Uncertainty principle:** It is impossible to know certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, with perfect accuracy.
