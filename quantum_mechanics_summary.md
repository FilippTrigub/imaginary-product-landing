# Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

## Key Concepts

* **Quantization:** Physical properties like energy, momentum, and angular momentum are restricted to discrete values.
* **Wave-particle duality:** Light and matter exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
* **Uncertainty principle:** There is a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, such as position and momentum, can be known.
* **Quantum entanglement:** A physical phenomenon that occurs when a pair or group of particles is generated, interacts, or shares spatial proximity in such a way that the quantum state of each particle of the pair or group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distance.
