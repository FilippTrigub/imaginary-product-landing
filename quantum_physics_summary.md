# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. It emerged in the early 20th century to explain phenomena that classical physics could not.

## Key Concepts

*   **Quantization:** Energy is not continuous but comes in discrete units called "quanta." This idea was first introduced by Max Planck.
*   **Wave-Particle Duality:** Particles like electrons and photons can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
*   **Superposition:** A quantum system can be in multiple states at the same time until it is measured.
*   **Entanglement:** Two or more quantum particles can be linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, no matter how far apart they are.
*   **Uncertainty Principle:** Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, such as position and momentum, can be known.

## Applications

Quantum mechanics is the foundation for many modern technologies, including:

*   **Lasers:** Used in everything from Blu-ray players to medical surgery.
*   **Semiconductors:** The basis of all modern electronics, including computers and smartphones.
*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** A medical imaging technique that uses quantum properties of atomic nuclei.
*   **Quantum Computing:** A new type of computing that leverages quantum phenomena to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers.
