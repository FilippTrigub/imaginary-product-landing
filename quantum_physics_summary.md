# Quantum Physics (Quantum Mechanics) — Summary

Quantum mechanics is the fundamental physical theory describing the behavior of matter and light at atomic and subatomic scales. It forms the foundation of **quantum physics**, which encompasses related fields such as quantum chemistry, quantum biology, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science. At these scales, systems exhibit behaviors that differ from classical physics, and quantum mechanics provides the framework for understanding and predicting those phenomena.
