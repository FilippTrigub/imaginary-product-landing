# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

Key concepts:
- Duality of particles and waves
- Probability in quantum events
- Quantum states and wave functions
- Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
