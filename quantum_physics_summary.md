# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. It fundamentally differs from classical physics by introducing probabilistic rather than deterministic descriptions of physical phenomena.

## Key Principles

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
Matter and energy exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. Light can behave as both electromagnetic waves and discrete particles (photons), while electrons and other particles can demonstrate wave-like interference patterns.

### 2. Quantum Superposition
Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured or observed. A quantum system can be in a superposition of multiple possible states, only "collapsing" to a definite state upon measurement.

### 3. Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that certain pairs of physical properties (like position and momentum) cannot both be known with arbitrary precision simultaneously. The more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be known.

### 4. Quantum Entanglement
When particles become entangled, the quantum state of one particle becomes correlated with the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them. Measuring one particle instantaneously affects the state of its entangled partner.

## Applications

Quantum physics has led to numerous technological advances:
- Semiconductors and transistors
- Lasers and fiber optics
- MRI scanners
- Atomic clocks
- Quantum computing (emerging field)

## Significance

Quantum physics represents one of the most successful and thoroughly tested theories in science, providing the foundation for understanding chemistry, material science, and the behavior of fundamental particles. Despite its counterintuitive nature, it has been validated through countless experiments and remains essential to modern technology.
