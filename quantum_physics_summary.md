# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. It represents a fundamental departure from classical physics and has revolutionized our understanding of the physical world.

## Key Principles

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
Matter and energy exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. Particles such as electrons and photons can behave as waves under certain conditions and as particles under others.

### 2. Quantum Superposition
Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until they are measured. This principle is famously illustrated by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.

### 3. Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that certain pairs of physical properties (like position and momentum) cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision. The more precisely one property is known, the less precisely the other can be determined.

### 4. Quantum Entanglement
When particles become entangled, the quantum state of one particle instantaneously influences the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."

### 5. Quantization
Energy, momentum, and other physical properties exist in discrete units called quanta, rather than continuous values. This is where the term "quantum" originates.

## Applications

Quantum physics has led to numerous technological innovations:
- Semiconductors and transistors
- Lasers
- MRI scanners
- Quantum computing
- Cryptography
- Nuclear energy

## Significance

Quantum mechanics has fundamentally changed our understanding of reality, challenging classical intuitions about determinism, locality, and the nature of observation. It remains one of the most successful and thoroughly tested theories in physics, despite its counterintuitive implications.
