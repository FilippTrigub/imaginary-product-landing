# Quantum Physics — A Brief Summary

## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at the most fundamental level. It describes the behavior of particles such as electrons, photons, and atoms — objects so small that they follow rules very different from the everyday (classical) world we experience.

## Key Concepts

### Wave-Particle Duality
Matter and light exhibit properties of both particles and waves, depending on how they are measured. They are distinct quantum objects that cannot be neatly categorized as one or the other.

### Superposition
A quantum object can exist in a combination of multiple possible states simultaneously — until a measurement is made, at which point it "collapses" into a single definite state.

### Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that certain pairs of physical properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot both be known to arbitrary precision at the same time. Measuring one with high accuracy inherently limits the precision of the other.

### Entanglement
Two or more particles can become linked such that the state of one instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of the distance separating them — what Einstein famously called "spooky action at a distance."

## Brief History

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1900 | Max Planck proposes energy comes in discrete packets called *quanta*. |
| 1905 | Albert Einstein explains the photoelectric effect, showing light's particle nature. |
| 1925–1927 | Schrödinger and Heisenberg develop wave mechanics and matrix mechanics. |
| 1935 | Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen describe entanglement. |

## Why It Matters

Quantum physics underpins much of modern technology:

- **Lasers** — used in medicine, communications, and manufacturing.
- **Semiconductors & transistors** — the foundation of all modern electronics.
- **MRI machines** — medical imaging relying on quantum spin properties.
- **GPS systems** — dependent on precise atomic clocks governed by quantum effects.

## The Future

Emerging quantum technologies promise transformative advances:

- **Quantum Computing** — solving problems intractable for classical computers.
- **Quantum Networking** — enabling fundamentally secure communication.
- **Quantum Sensors** — ultra-sensitive detection for medicine and environmental monitoring.
- **Advanced Materials** — discovery of new materials with novel quantum properties.
