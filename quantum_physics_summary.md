# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. It represents one of the most fundamental theories in modern physics.

## Key Principles

### Wave-Particle Duality
Particles at the quantum level exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This means that entities such as electrons and photons can behave as waves or particles depending on how they are observed.

### Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and exact momentum of a particle with perfect precision. The more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be known.

### Superposition
Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until they are measured. This is famously illustrated by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, where a cat in a box is considered both alive and dead until observed.

### Quantum Entanglement
When particles become entangled, the quantum state of one particle becomes dependent on the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance."

## Applications

- **Quantum Computing**: Leverages superposition and entanglement to perform calculations exponentially faster than classical computers for certain problems
- **Cryptography**: Quantum key distribution enables theoretically unbreakable encryption
- **Medical Imaging**: MRI scanners utilize quantum properties of atomic nuclei
- **Semiconductors**: Transistors and modern electronics rely on quantum mechanical principles

## Historical Development

Quantum physics emerged in the early 20th century with contributions from pioneers including Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrödinger. The theory challenged classical physics and revolutionized our understanding of the fundamental nature of reality.

## Conclusion

Quantum physics continues to be an active area of research, pushing the boundaries of technology and our understanding of the universe at its most fundamental level.
