# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview

Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. At these microscopic levels, the classical laws of physics break down and are replaced by quantum mechanical principles.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
Matter and energy exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. Light, for example, can behave as both electromagnetic waves and discrete packets of energy called photons.

### 2. Quantization
Energy, momentum, and other physical properties are quantized, meaning they can only exist in discrete values rather than continuous ranges. This is exemplified in electron energy levels in atoms.

### 3. Uncertainty Principle
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, cannot be simultaneously known with arbitrary precision. The more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be known.

### 4. Superposition
Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. The famous thought experiment of Schrödinger's cat illustrates this principle, where the cat is both alive and dead until observed.

### 5. Quantum Entanglement
Particles can become entangled, meaning the quantum state of one particle is directly related to the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."
