# Key Concepts of Quantum Physics

## Core Principles

- **Quantization**: Physical properties (energy, momentum, angular momentum) exist in discrete, quantized values rather than continuous ranges.
- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles (e.g., electrons, photons) exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behavior depending on the experimental setup.
- **Uncertainty Principle**: It’s impossible to simultaneously know exact values of certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum); expressed as σₓσₚ ≥ ℏ/2.
- **Superposition**: A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured (e.g., Schrödinger’s cat being both alive and dead).
- **Entanglement**: Two or more particles become linked such that the state of one instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of distance (nonlocality).

## Mathematical Framework

- **Wave Function (ψ)**: Describes the quantum state of a system; its square gives the probability density of finding a particle at a given location (Born rule).
- **Schrödinger Equation**: Governs the time evolution of the wave function: iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ.
- **Operators & Observables**: Physical quantities (position, momentum, energy) are represented by Hermitian operators; measurement yields eigenvalues.
- **Collapse**: Upon measurement, the wave function collapses to a single eigenstate corresponding to the measured value.

## Notable Phenomena

- **Quantum Tunneling**: Particles can pass through potential barriers even if their energy is less than the barrier height.
- **Interference**: Quantum waves can constructively or destructively interfere (e.g., double-slit experiment).
- **Decoherence**: Interaction with the environment causes loss of quantum coherence, explaining the transition to classical behavior.

## Interpretations & Implications

- **Copenhagen Interpretation**: Measurement causes wave function collapse; probabilities reflect fundamental indeterminism.
- **Many-Worlds Interpretation**: All possible outcomes occur in separate, non-communicating branches of reality.
- **Bell’s Theorem**: Proves that no local hidden-variable theory can reproduce all quantum predictions; entanglement is nonlocal.

## Applications

- **Technology**: Transistors, lasers, MRI, quantum computing, cryptography, and semiconductors.
- **Science**: Quantum chemistry, materials science, nuclear physics, and cosmology.

## Relation to Classical Physics

- **Correspondence Principle**: Quantum mechanics reduces to classical mechanics at macroscopic scales or large quantum numbers.
- **Incompatibility with General Relativity**: Quantum theory and gravity remain ununified; string theory and loop quantum gravity are leading candidates for quantum gravity.
