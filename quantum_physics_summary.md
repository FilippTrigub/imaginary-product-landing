# Quantum Physics Summary

## Introduction
Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. It represents a fundamental departure from classical physics and has revolutionized our understanding of the universe.

## Core Principles

### Wave-Particle Duality
Matter and energy exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This dual nature is fundamental to quantum mechanics, where particles like electrons can behave as waves and light can behave as particles (photons).

### Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that certain pairs of physical properties (like position and momentum) cannot be simultaneously known with arbitrary precision. The more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be determined.

### Quantum Superposition
Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. The famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment illustrates this concept, where a quantum system remains in a superposition of states until observation collapses it into a definite state.

### Quantum Entanglement
When particles become entangled, the quantum state of one particle is intrinsically linked to the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."

## Applications

- **Quantum Computing**: Leverages superposition and entanglement for computational power
- **Quantum Cryptography**: Provides theoretically unbreakable encryption
- **Semiconductor Technology**: Modern electronics rely on quantum mechanical principles
- **Lasers and LEDs**: Based on quantum transitions of electrons
- **Medical Imaging**: Technologies like MRI utilize quantum properties

## Significance
Quantum physics has not only transformed theoretical physics but has also enabled numerous technological innovations that shape modern society. It continues to be an active area of research with implications for future technologies and our understanding of reality itself.
