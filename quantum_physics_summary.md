# Key Concepts of Quantum Physics

Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is the fundamental physical theory that describes the behavior of matter and light at atomic and subatomic scales. Unlike classical physics, which can accurately describe macroscopic phenomena, quantum mechanics reveals a world where particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, and precise predictions are replaced by probabilities.

A core principle of quantum mechanics is **wave-particle duality**, famously demonstrated by the double-slit experiment. Particles like electrons and photons can create interference patterns characteristic of waves, yet are detected as discrete particles. This leads to the concept of the **wave function**, a mathematical description that provides probability amplitudes for finding a particle in various states. According to the **Born rule**, the probability of finding a particle in a particular location is given by the square of the absolute value of its wave function.

Quantum mechanics introduces several non-classical phenomena:
- **Uncertainty Principle**: It's impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle. This isn't due to measurement limitations but reflects a fundamental property of quantum systems.
- **Quantum Superposition**: Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured, at which point the wave function "collapses" to a definite state.
- **Quantum Entanglement**: When particles interact, they can become linked such that the state of one instantly influences the state of another, regardless of distance. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."
- **Quantum Tunneling**: Particles can pass through energy barriers that would be impossible to surmount according to classical physics, enabling phenomena like radioactive decay and nuclear fusion in stars.

These quantum principles have been experimentally verified with extraordinary precision and form the foundation for modern technologies including semiconductors, lasers, MRI machines, and quantum computing. Despite its predictive success, quantum mechanics remains philosophically challenging, with ongoing debates about the nature of reality and the role of observation in determining physical states.
