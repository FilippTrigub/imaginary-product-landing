# Quantum Physics Summary

Based on the Wikipedia article, here are the key concepts of quantum mechanics:

## Wave-Particle Duality
Light and matter exhibit both particle and wave characteristics depending on how they're measured. This is demonstrated by the double-slit experiment, where particles like electrons create interference patterns (like waves) but are detected as discrete points (like particles). The phenomenon is fundamental to quantum mechanics and shows that quantum entities don't fit classical categories.

## Superposition
Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously. A quantum state can be a linear combination of eigenstates, meaning a particle can be in all possible positions or states at once until measured. The wave function represents this superposition of possibilities. The Mach-Zehnder interferometer demonstrates this principle in a simple two-path system.

## Uncertainty Principle
You cannot precisely know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously. The more precisely you know one property, the less precisely you can know the other. This isn't due to measurement limitations but is a fundamental property of quantum systems, arising from the non-commutation of certain observable operators.

## Entanglement
When quantum systems interact, they can become "entangled," with their properties so interconnected that a description of the whole system cannot be described simply by combining individual parts. Measurements on one part instantaneously affect the other, regardless of distance. This phenomenon enables quantum computing and communication protocols like quantum key distribution.

These principles collectively show that quantum mechanics describes reality differently from classical physics, using probability amplitudes, Hilbert spaces, and measurement operators to predict the behavior of microscopic systems.
