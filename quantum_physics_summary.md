# Quantum Physics — A Brief Summary

## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics (also called quantum mechanics or quantum field theory) is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the molecular, atomic, nuclear, and subatomic scales. At these tiny scales, the rules of classical physics break down and are replaced by a fundamentally different — and often counter-intuitive — set of principles.

## Historical Origins

| Year | Milestone | Key Figure(s) |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| 1900 | Introduction of energy quanta to explain black-body radiation | Max Planck |
| 1905 | Light-quanta hypothesis & photoelectric effect | Albert Einstein |
| 1913 | Quantised atomic model explaining hydrogen spectral lines | Niels Bohr |
| 1924 | Matter-wave hypothesis | Louis de Broglie |
| 1925 | Matrix mechanics | Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Pascual Jordan |
| 1926 | Wave equation (Schrödinger equation) | Erwin Schrödinger |
| 1927 | Uncertainty principle | Werner Heisenberg |
| 1928 | Relativistic wave equation & prediction of antimatter | Paul Dirac |

The term **"quantum mechanics"** was coined by Max Born, Werner Heisenberg, and Wolfgang Pauli at the University of Göttingen in the early 1920s.

## Key Concepts

- **Wave–Particle Duality**: Quantum objects (photons, electrons) exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on the experiment. The classic demonstration is the *double-slit experiment*.

- **Uncertainty Principle**: It is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and exact momentum of a particle. The more precisely one is measured, the less precisely the other can be known.

- **Superposition**: A quantum system can exist in multiple states at once until it is measured, at which point it "collapses" into a definite state.

- **Quantum Entanglement**: Two or more particles can become correlated such that measuring the state of one instantly determines the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. Confirmed experimentally through tests of *Bell's Theorem*.

- **Quantum Tunnelling**: A particle can pass through an energy barrier that it classically should not be able to cross.

## Major Sub-fields

- **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: Describes the interaction between light and matter (electrons and photons). Developed by Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. Its predictions are accurate to eleven decimal places.

- **Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**: The theoretical framework underlying modern particle physics and the Standard Model.

- **Quantum Optics**: Studies the quantum behavior of photons; underpins laser technology.

- **Quantum Information Science**: Encompasses quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication. Key milestones include Shor's algorithm (1994) and quantum key distribution (Bennett & Brassard, 1984).

## Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics

Several competing interpretations attempt to explain *what the math means*:

1. **Copenhagen Interpretation** — The wave function represents probabilities; measurement causes collapse.
2. **Many-Worlds Interpretation** — Every quantum measurement causes the universe to branch into parallel realities.
3. **De Broglie–Bohm (Pilot Wave) Theory** — Particles have definite positions guided by a pilot wave.
4. **Consistent Histories** — Quantum events can be described without invoking wave-function collapse.

## Why It Matters

Quantum physics is not just abstract theory — it underpins a vast range of modern technology:

- **Semiconductors & transistors** (the basis of all modern electronics)
- **Lasers**
- **MRI scanners**
- **Quantum computers** (emerging technology promising exponential speed-ups for certain problems)
- **Cryptography & secure communication**
