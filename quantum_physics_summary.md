# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a foundational branch of science that studies matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. It explores the behavior of particles like atoms, electrons, and photons, especially at extremely cold temperatures.

Unlike classical physics, which governs the macroscopic world, quantum physics reveals a counterintuitive reality with different rules. Key concepts include:

*   **Superposition:** A particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.
*   **Entanglement:** Two particles can become linked, where the state of one instantly affects the other, regardless of distance.
*   **Wave-particle duality:** Light and matter exhibit both particle and wave properties.
*   **Uncertainty Principle:** There are inherent limits to precisely knowing certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, at the same time.

Quantum physics is vital for understanding nature's building blocks and has led to advancements in materials science, chemistry, biology, astronomy, and technologies like lasers, transistors, and quantum computing. Physicists are also working to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity to develop a "theory of everything."
