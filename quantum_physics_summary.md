# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales, where classical physics no longer applies.

## Fundamental Principles

### Wave-Particle Duality
Matter and energy exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. Particles such as electrons and photons can behave as waves under certain conditions and as discrete particles under others.

### Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and exact momentum of a particle. The more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be known.

### Quantum Superposition
Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured or observed. The famous thought experiment of Schrödinger's cat illustrates this concept, where a cat in a box can be considered both alive and dead until the box is opened.

### Quantum Entanglement
When particles become entangled, the quantum state of one particle is directly related to the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."

## Key Concepts

### Quantization
Energy, momentum, and other physical properties exist in discrete units called quanta, rather than continuous values.

### Probability and Wave Functions
The behavior of quantum systems is described by wave functions, which provide probabilities of finding a particle in a particular state rather than deterministic predictions.

### Measurement Problem
The act of measurement causes a quantum system to collapse from a superposition of states into a single definite state.

## Applications
- Quantum computing
- Semiconductor technology
- Lasers and LED technology
- Medical imaging (MRI, PET scans)
- Cryptography and secure communications

## Significance
Quantum physics revolutionized our understanding of the universe at the smallest scales and continues to drive technological innovation in the 21st century.
