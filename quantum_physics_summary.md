# Quantum Physics: Key Concepts

## What is Quantum Physics?
Quantum physics (or quantum mechanics) is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales—typically atoms and subatomic particles. It provides a mathematical framework to describe phenomena that cannot be explained by classical physics.

## Key Principles

### 1. Superposition
- A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured.
- Example: An electron can be in a superposition of spin-up and spin-down states.
- Schrödinger’s cat thought experiment illustrates this concept.

### 2. Entanglement
- Two or more particles can become entangled, meaning the state of one particle is instantly correlated with the state of another, no matter the distance between them.
- Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."
- Used in quantum computing and cryptography.

### 3. Uncertainty Principle (Heisenberg)
- It is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle.
- The more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be known.
- Reflects the fundamental limits of measurement in quantum systems.

## Applications in Modern Technology

### 1. Quantum Computing
- Uses qubits (quantum bits) that leverage superposition and entanglement to perform complex calculations exponentially faster than classical computers.
- Potential applications: Cryptography, drug discovery, optimization problems.

### 2. Quantum Cryptography
- Uses quantum entanglement to create theoretically unhackable communication channels (e.g., Quantum Key Distribution, QKD).

### 3. Medical Imaging & Sensors
- MRI machines rely on quantum principles to image internal body structures.
- Quantum sensors enable ultra-precise measurements in fields like geology and navigation.

### 4. Semiconductors & Electronics
- Transistors, the building blocks of modern electronics, operate based on quantum mechanical principles.
