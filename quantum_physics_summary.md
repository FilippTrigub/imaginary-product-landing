# Summary of Quantum Physics

Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of nature at the atomic and subatomic levels. It challenges the principles of classical physics with concepts like:

*   **Wave-particle duality:** Particles can exhibit properties of both waves and particles.
*   **Quantization:** Energy is not continuous but comes in discrete units called quanta.
*   **Uncertainty principle:** It's impossible to know certain pairs of physical properties, such as a particle's position and momentum, with absolute precision.

## Key Concepts

*   **Superposition:** A quantum system can be in multiple states at the same time until it is measured.
*   **Entanglement:** Two or more quantum particles can be linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, no matter how far apart they are. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."
*   **Quantum Leap:** When an electron jumps from one energy level to another, it does so instantaneously, without traversing the space in between.

## Impact and Applications

Quantum physics has revolutionized our understanding of the universe and has led to a wide range of technological advancements, including:

*   **Lasers**
*   **Transistors** (the foundation of modern computers)
*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**
*   **Atomic clocks**
*   **Quantum computing** (an emerging technology with the potential to solve problems currently intractable for classical computers)
