# Key Concepts of Quantum Physics

## Core Principles
- **Quantization**: Physical properties (energy, momentum, angular momentum) exist in discrete, quantized values rather than continuous ranges
- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Quantum entities exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behavior depending on the experimental context
- **Probability & Uncertainty**: Outcomes are inherently probabilistic; the theory predicts probabilities rather than definite results
- **Superposition**: Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured

## Fundamental Phenomena
- **Uncertainty Principle**: Certain pairs of properties (like position and momentum) cannot be precisely known simultaneously
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Particles can become linked such that the state of one instantly influences the other, regardless of distance
- **Quantum Tunneling**: Particles can pass through energy barriers that would be impossible to cross in classical physics
- **Quantum Interference**: Probability amplitudes can constructively or destructively interfere, as demonstrated in the double-slit experiment

## Mathematical Framework
- **Wave Function**: Describes the quantum state using probability amplitudes (complex numbers)
- **Schrödinger Equation**: Governs how quantum states evolve over time deterministically
- **Measurement Collapse**: Upon measurement, the wave function collapses to a definite state
- **Hilbert Space**: Quantum states exist as vectors in a complex mathematical space

## Key Applications
- Quantum computing and quantum information science
- Semiconductor technology and transistors
- Lasers and quantum optics
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
- Superconductivity and superfluidity

## Historical Development
- Emerged in early 20th century to explain phenomena classical physics couldn't
- Key contributors: Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, Born, and Dirac
- Replaced the "old quantum theory" with a complete mathematical framework in the 1920s
