# Quantum Physics: A Summary

## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics is the branch of science that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales — atoms, electrons, and photons. Unlike classical physics, which describes the everyday world we experience, quantum mechanics reveals a fundamentally different reality governed by its own set of rules.

## Key Principles

### 1. Wave–Particle Duality
Matter and light exhibit properties of both particles and waves, depending on how they are measured. This was first demonstrated in the famous **double-slit experiment** (1801 and beyond).

### 2. Superposition
A quantum object can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured. Only upon observation does it "collapse" into a single definite state.

### 3. Entanglement
Two or more particles can become linked so that the state of one instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. Einstein famously called this *"spooky action at a distance."*

### 4. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
Certain pairs of physical properties — such as position and momentum — cannot both be precisely known at the same time. The more accurately one is measured, the less precisely the other can be determined.

### 5. Quantization
Energy is not continuous but comes in discrete packets called **quanta**. This was Max Planck's foundational insight in 1900.

## Brief History

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1900 | Max Planck proposes energy quantization |
| 1905 | Einstein explains the photoelectric effect |
| 1925–1927 | Schrödinger and Heisenberg develop wave and matrix mechanics |
| 1928 | Dirac publishes his relativistic wave equation, predicting antimatter |
| 1935 | Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen describe entanglement (EPR paradox) |

## Everyday Applications

Quantum physics isn't just theoretical — it underpins much of modern technology:

- **Semiconductors & transistors** — the chips in smartphones and computers
- **Lasers** — barcode scanners, fiber-optic internet, eye surgery
- **MRI machines** — medical imaging
- **LEDs & solar panels** — energy-efficient lighting and power generation
- **GPS systems** — satellite navigation

## The Future of Quantum Technology

- **Quantum Computing** — solving problems intractable for classical supercomputers
- **Quantum Networking & Cryptography** — physically secure communication based on the laws of physics
- **Quantum Sensors** — ultra-sensitive devices for early disease detection and environmental monitoring
- **Advanced Materials** — discovering materials with entirely new properties

## Recent Developments (Early 2026)

- **Hidden quantum geometry** discovered inside materials that steers electrons similarly to how gravity warps light (Feb 2026)
- **Hidden magnetic order** found to play a key role in the pseudogap, a precursor state to superconductivity (Jan 2026)
- **Phonon laser** created on a microchip, potentially transforming future electronics (Jan 2026)
- **Quantum encryption** demonstrated at city-sized distances for the first time (Feb 2026)
- **Quantum batteries** research shows potential to quadruple qubit capacity (Jan 2026)
