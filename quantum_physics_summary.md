# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

## Key Concepts

1. **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles such as electrons and photons can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.

2. **Quantization**: Certain properties, such as energy and angular momentum, are quantized, meaning they can only take on discrete values.

3. **Uncertainty Principle**: It is impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision.

4. **Superposition**: A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured.

5. **Entanglement**: Particles can become entangled, meaning the state of one particle is dependent on the state of another, no matter the distance between them.

## Applications

Quantum physics has led to the development of technologies such as lasers, transistors, and quantum computers. It also plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of materials and the fundamental forces of nature.
