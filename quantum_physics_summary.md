# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics is a fundamental theory describing matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales. It explores the behavior of the universe's smallest building blocks, such as molecules, atoms, electrons, and photons.

## Key Concepts:
*   **Quantization and Discrete States:** Physical quantities like energy exist in discrete units called quanta.
*   **Wave-Particle Duality:** Quantum objects exhibit characteristics of both particles and waves.
*   **Superposition:** A quantum particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.
*   **Quantum Entanglement:** Two or more particles become interconnected, influencing each other instantly regardless of distance.
*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** There are limits to how accurately certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) can be known simultaneously.

## Applications:
Quantum physics underpins modern technology and our understanding of the universe.
*   **Lasers:** Used in barcode scanners, DVD players, and fiber optics.
*   **Semiconductors and Transistors:** Essential in electronic devices like smartphones and computers.
*   **Medical Imaging:** MRI machines rely on quantum principles.
*   **GPS Systems:** Guided by quantum physics.
*   **LEDs and Solar Panels:** Explained by quantum mechanics.

Ongoing research is paving the way for future technologies like quantum computing and quantum encryption.
