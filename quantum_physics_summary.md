# Quantum Physics: A Brief Overview

Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at the most fundamental level, examining the properties and behaviors of the building blocks of nature.

## Key Concepts

### Wave-Particle Duality
Light and matter exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties depending on how they are measured. The famous double-slit experiment demonstrates this—electrons passing through two slits create an interference pattern characteristic of waves, not the two-cluster pattern expected from particles.

### Superposition
A quantum object can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured. When waves overlap, they combine point-by-point to yield a new wave. In quantum systems, this means a particle can be in a combination of states (e.g., both spin-up and spin-down) at the same time.

### Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Heisenberg, this principle states that complementary properties (such as position and momentum) cannot both be precisely known simultaneously. Measuring one property with precision limits how accurately the other can be determined.

### Quantum Entanglement
When two or more particles become entangled, they remain connected even when separated by vast distances. Measuring one particle instantly reveals information about its entangled partner. This correlation exists without faster-than-light communication—the entangled particles behave as a single unified system.

## Applications

Quantum discoveries underpin many modern technologies:
- **Lasers and transistors** — foundational to computing and communications
- **Quantum computing** — leverages superposition and entanglement for powerful computation
- **Quantum cryptography** — enables theoretically unbreakable encryption
