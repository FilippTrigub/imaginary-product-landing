# Quantum Mechanics: A Brief Summary

## Overview

Quantum mechanics is the fundamental physical theory that describes the behavior of matter and light at atomic and subatomic scales. It emerged in the early 20th century to explain phenomena that classical physics couldn't account for, such as black-body radiation and the photoelectric effect.

## Key Concepts and Principles

### Wave-Particle Duality
Matter and energy exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on how they are observed. Light can behave as both waves and particles (photons).

### Uncertainty Principle
Proposed by Heisenberg, it states that certain pairs of properties (like position and momentum) cannot be simultaneously measured with perfect precision.

### Superposition
Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured, as illustrated by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.

### Quantization
Energy, momentum, and other quantities come in discrete packets called "quanta," unlike classical physics where these vary continuously.

### Entanglement
Particles can become "entangled" such that their properties remain correlated regardless of the distance separating them, as demonstrated by Bell's theorem experiments.

### Quantum Tunneling
Particles can pass through potential barriers that should be insurmountable according to classical physics.

## Mathematical Formulation

Quantum states are described by wave functions (ψ) in a complex Hilbert space. The probability of finding a particle in a particular state is given by the Born rule: |ψ|². The Schrödinger equation governs the time evolution of quantum systems:

iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ

where Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator representing the system's total energy.

## Relationship with Other Theories

Quantum mechanics bridges with classical mechanics at macroscopic scales through the correspondence principle. When combined with special relativity, it leads to quantum field theory. The unification of quantum mechanics with general relativity remains an active area of research in developing a theory of quantum gravity.
