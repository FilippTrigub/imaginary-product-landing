# Quantum Physics — A Brief Summary

## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics (also known as quantum mechanics) is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scale. At this level, particles do not follow deterministic paths but instead behave according to probabilities. The field emerged in the late 1800s and early 1900s from experimental observations that could not be explained by classical physics.

## Core Principles

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
Quantum objects such as electrons and photons can exhibit properties of both particles and waves, depending on how they are measured. They are best understood as distinct quantum objects that defy simple classical categorization.

### 2. Superposition
A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously. Only upon measurement does the system "collapse" into a single definite state. Mathematically, a superposed object is represented by an equation with more than one solution.

### 3. Quantum Entanglement
Two or more particles can become linked so that the state of one instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of the distance separating them. Entanglement is a key resource for quantum computing and quantum communication protocols.

### 4. Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that certain pairs of physical properties — such as position and momentum — cannot both be precisely known at the same time. Greater precision in one measurement necessarily reduces precision in the other.

### 5. Quantum Tunneling
Particles have a non-zero probability of passing through energy barriers that classical physics would deem impenetrable.

## Real-World Applications

- **Lasers** — operate using quantum emission of photons
- **Transistors & Semiconductors** — built on quantum behavior of electrons
- **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)** — utilizes nuclear spin and quantum magnetic properties
- **Quantum Computers** — leverage superposition and entanglement via qubits
- **Quantum Cryptography** — offers security grounded in the laws of physics rather than computational difficulty

## Recent Developments (2026)

- **IBM unveils new quantum supercomputers**; Denmark announces plans for the world's most powerful commercial quantum computer.
- Researchers demonstrate **quantum encryption (QKD) at city-sized distances** for the first time.
- Advances in **quantum sensors**, including intercity quantum sensor networks for dark matter detection.
- Progress in **quantum error correction**, including "surgery" on quantum bits to fix bit-flip errors.
- New theoretical work shows **three-way quantum correlations fade exponentially** with distance at non-zero temperatures.

## Why It Matters

Quantum physics is not just abstract theory — it underpins much of modern technology and continues to open doors to faster computing, unhackable communications, advanced medical imaging, and new materials. Understanding quantum principles provides essential context for the technologies shaping our future.
