# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics explores the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales—atoms, electrons, and photons—revealing a universe that operates under fundamentally different rules than our everyday classical world.

## Key Principles

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
Every object in the universe has both particle-like and wave-like properties. Matter and energy come in discrete chunks (quantized), yet also exhibit wave behaviors like diffraction and interference.

### 2. Superposition
Particles can exist in multiple places or states simultaneously until observed. This defies our classical intuition but is fundamental to quantum behavior.

### 3. Quantum Entanglement
Two particles can be mysteriously linked so that what happens to one instantaneously affects the other, even when separated by vast distances. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."

### 4. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
There are fundamental limits to what we can know about quantum systems. The more precisely we measure certain properties (like position), the less precisely we can know others (like momentum).

### 5. Quantum Measurement
The very act of observing or measuring a quantum system can change its state. This observer effect is built into the fabric of quantum reality.

## Real-World Applications
Quantum physics forms the foundation of many modern technologies including semiconductors, lasers, medical imaging, and emerging quantum computing technologies.

## Why It Matters
Understanding quantum mechanics challenges our classical intuitions but provides the most accurate description of how the universe works at its most fundamental level, enabling technologies that power our modern world.
