# Quantum Physics Summary

## Introduction
Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior and properties of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales. Unlike classical physics, it deals with phenomena that are often counterintuitive to our everyday experiences.

## Key Principles

### Wave-Particle Duality
Quantum objects display both particle-like and wave-like properties depending on the experimental setup. Light, for example, can behave as both a particle (photon) and a wave.

### Quantization
Physical quantities such as energy, momentum, and angular momentum come in discrete packets known as "quanta." Energy levels in atoms are quantized, meaning electrons exist at specific energy levels.

### Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties (such as position and momentum) can be known simultaneously.

### Superposition
A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is observed or measured. This is famously illustrated by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.

### Entanglement
When quantum particles become entangled, the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently. Measuring one particle instantly affects the other, whatever the distance between them.

## Historical Development
- 1900: Max Planck introduces the concept of quanta to solve the black-body radiation problem
- 1905: Albert Einstein explains the photoelectric effect by proposing light quanta (photons)
- 1913: Niels Bohr applies quantum ideas to atomic structure, explaining hydrogen's spectrum
- 1925-1926: Modern quantum mechanics develops with contributions from Heisenberg and Schrödinger
- 1930s: David Hilbert, Paul Dirac, and John von Neumann formalize the mathematical framework

## Applications
Quantum mechanics is foundational to many modern technologies:
- Electronics: transistors, semiconductors, and integrated circuits
- Optics: lasers, LEDs, and fiber optics
- Medical technology: MRI scans, electron microscopy
- Materials science: superconductors and nanomaterials
- Emerging fields: quantum computing and quantum cryptography
