### Quantum Physics: Key Concepts and Recent Developments

#### Fundamental Principles
1. **Wave-Particle Duality**
   - Particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
   - Demonstrated by the double-slit experiment.

2. **Quantization**
   - Energy and other properties exist in discrete units (quanta).
   - Planck's constant (h) defines the smallest energy unit.

3. **Uncertainty Principle (Heisenberg)**
   - Position and momentum cannot both be precisely measured simultaneously.

4. **Superposition**
   - Quantum systems exist in multiple states until measured.
   - Example: Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.

5. **Entanglement**
   - Particles can be correlated such that the state of one instantly influences another, regardless of distance.

6. **Quantum Tunneling**
   - Particles can pass through energy barriers.
   - Enables nuclear fusion and technologies like scanning tunneling microscopes.

7. **Quantum Decoherence**
   - Interaction with the environment causes loss of quantum properties.

#### Recent Developments
1. **Quantum Computing**
   - Uses qubits (quantum bits) for exponentially faster calculations.
   - Google demonstrated quantum supremacy in 2019.

2. **Quantum Cryptography**
   - Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables theoretically unhackable encryption.
   - China's Micius satellite demonstrated QKD over 1,200 km.

3. **Quantum Sensors**
   - Ultra-precise measurements for applications like gravitational wave detection.

4. **Topological Quantum Computing**
   - Uses quasiparticles (anyons) for more stable qubits.

5. **Quantum Simulations**
   - Simulating molecules and materials to accelerate drug discovery.

6. **Post-Quantum Cryptography**
   - Developing encryption resistant to quantum attacks (e.g., Shor's algorithm).

7. **Quantum Internet**
   - Networks using entanglement for ultra-secure communication.
