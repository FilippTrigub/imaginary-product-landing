# Quantum Physics: A Brief Summary

## Overview
Quantum mechanics is the fundamental physical theory that describes the behavior of matter and light at atomic and subatomic scales. Unlike classical physics which can describe nature at macroscopic scales, quantum mechanics reveals unique properties that dominate at very small scales.

## Key Fundamental Concepts

### Wave-Particle Duality
Quantum systems exhibit characteristics of both particles and waves. In the famous double-slit experiment, particles like electrons behave as waves when forming interference patterns but are detected as discrete particles at specific locations on a screen.

### Quantization
In quantum systems, properties such as energy, momentum, and angular momentum are restricted to discrete values, unlike classical systems where these quantities can vary continuously. This principle explains the existence of energy levels in atoms.

### Uncertainty Principle
There are fundamental limits to the precision with which certain pairs of measurements can be predicted simultaneously. For example, the more precisely a particle's position is known, the less precisely its momentum can be known, expressed mathematically as σₓσₚ ≥ ℏ/2.

### Superposition
A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured. The system is described by a wave function that encompasses all possible states until observation collapses it into a specific state.

### Entanglement
When quantum systems interact, they can become entangled, with their properties becoming interdependent regardless of the distance between them. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance," though it doesn't allow faster-than-light signaling.

### Probability and the Born Rule
Quantum mechanics predicts probabilities rather than certainties. The square of the absolute value of the wave function's amplitude gives the probability density for finding a particle in a particular position.

### Wave Function Collapse
Upon measurement, a quantum system "collapses" from a superposition of possible states to a specific measured state determined by probability.

## Mathematical Framework
Quantum states are represented as vectors in a complex Hilbert space. Observable quantities are represented by Hermitian operators acting on this space. The time evolution of quantum states follows the Schrödinger equation: iℏ(∂/∂t)ψ(t) = Hψ(t), where H is the Hamiltonian representing the system's total energy.
