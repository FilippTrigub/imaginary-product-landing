# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview

Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is the fundamental theory in physics that describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles. It represents a revolutionary departure from classical physics, introducing concepts that challenge our everyday understanding of reality.

## Key Principles

### Wave-Particle Duality
Matter and energy exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. Particles such as electrons can behave as waves, and light can behave as particles (photons). This dual nature is fundamental to quantum mechanics.

### Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that certain pairs of physical properties (like position and momentum) cannot both be precisely measured simultaneously. The more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be known.

### Quantum Superposition
A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured or observed. The famous thought experiment "Schrödinger's cat" illustrates this concept, where a cat in a box can be simultaneously alive and dead until observed.

### Quantum Entanglement
When particles become entangled, their quantum states become correlated such that measuring one particle instantaneously affects the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."

## Applications

Quantum physics has enabled numerous modern technologies:

- **Semiconductors and transistors** - Foundation of modern computing
- **Lasers** - Used in medicine, communications, and industry
- **MRI scanners** - Medical imaging technology
- **Quantum computing** - Emerging technology with potential for unprecedented computational power
- **Quantum cryptography** - Secure communication systems

## Significance

Quantum physics has fundamentally transformed our understanding of the universe, revealing that at the smallest scales, nature behaves in ways that are counterintuitive and probabilistic rather than deterministic. It remains one of the most successful and rigorously tested theories in science.
