# Quantum Physics: Fundamental Principles and Applications

## Fundamental Principles

1. **Quantization**
   - Energy and other properties exist in discrete packets called "quanta"
   - Example: Electron energy levels in atoms are quantized

2. **Wave-Particle Duality**
   - Particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior
   - Example: Light behaves as waves (interference) and particles (photoelectric effect)

3. **Uncertainty Principle**
   - Cannot simultaneously measure certain pairs of properties with perfect precision
   - Example: Position and momentum cannot both be precisely known

4. **Superposition**
   - Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured
   - Example: Schrödinger's cat thought experiment

5. **Entanglement**
   - Particles can become correlated such that measuring one instantly affects another
   - Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance"

6. **Quantum Tunneling**
   - Particles can pass through energy barriers they classically shouldn't be able to
   - Enables nuclear fusion in stars and scanning tunneling microscopes
