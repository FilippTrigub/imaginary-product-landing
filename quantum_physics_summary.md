# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics is the branch of science that explores the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales of our universe—atoms, electrons, and photons. Unlike classical physics that governs our everyday world, quantum physics follows its own set of rules that often seem counterintuitive.

## Key Principles

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
- Light and matter can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties
- Photons (light particles) can be counted like marbles
- Large molecules can create interference patterns like water waves

### 2. Quantum Superposition
- Particles can exist in multiple places at once until measured
- A particle behaves as though it is both here and there simultaneously
- Only when measured does it collapse to a definite state

### 3. Quantum Entanglement
- Two particles can be mysteriously linked across vast distances
- What happens to one particle instantly affects the other
- Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance"

### 4. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
- There are fundamental limits to what we can know about particles
- The more precisely we measure one property, the less precisely we can know another
- Uncertainty is fundamental to quantum mechanics

## Historical Context

At the dawn of the 20th century, classical physics was thought to be complete. However, puzzles like blackbody radiation revealed cracks in classical understanding, leading to the quantum revolution that changed our perception of reality.

## Modern Applications

Quantum physics is the foundation of much modern technology:
- Lasers
- Computers and smartphones
- MRI machines
- Quantum computing (emerging field)

## The Two Golden Rules

1. A particle can be in quantum superposition where it behaves as though it is both here and there
2. When measured, the particle will be found either here or there

These simple rules explain many of quantum mechanics' remarkable phenomena, applying to position, momentum, spin, and polarization.

Quantum physics shows that probability is at the heart of reality—we can never know what will happen for sure, only how likely it is that something might happen.
