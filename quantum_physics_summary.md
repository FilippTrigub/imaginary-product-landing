# Quantum Physics: A Summary

Quantum physics is the branch of science that studies matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scale, where particles behave differently from everyday objects.

## Key Principles

- **Superposition**: Particles can exist in multiple states at once until observed
- **Entanglement**: Particles can be connected across distance, where measuring one instantly affects the other (Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance")
- **Wave-particle duality**: Matter can act as both a wave and a particle

## Historical Milestones

- **1900**: Max Planck introduces Planck's constant
- **1905**: Einstein's photoelectric effect
- **1926**: Schrödinger's equation
- **2026**: Ongoing quantum computing advancements

## Real-World Applications

Quantum physics powers many modern technologies:
- Lasers
- Computers and smartphones
- MRI machines
- Quantum computers (emerging)

## Why It Matters

Quantum physics challenges our everyday understanding of reality and is fundamental to understanding the universe at its most basic level. It continues to drive technological innovations in medicine, cryptography, and artificial intelligence.
