# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels, where the rules of classical physics no longer apply.

## Key Concepts

### Wave-Particle Duality
Quantum entities exhibit properties of both particles and waves. The same object can behave as a particle in some experiments and as a wave in others, depending on how it is observed and measured.

### Quantization
Energy, angular momentum, and other physical properties are quantized, meaning they can only take on discrete values rather than continuous values. These discrete packets of energy are called quanta.

### Superposition
A quantum system can exist in a superposition of multiple states simultaneously until it is measured. The act of measurement causes the system to collapse into one definite state. This is famously illustrated by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.

### Uncertainty Principle
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and exact momentum of a particle with perfect precision. There is a fundamental limit to how precisely pairs of physical properties can be known.

### Entanglement
Quantum entanglement occurs when two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the quantum state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon has been called "spooky action at a distance" by Einstein.

### Quantum Tunneling
Quantum tunneling is the phenomenon where particles can pass through potential energy barriers that would be impossible to cross according to classical physics. This occurs because particles have wave-like properties.

## Foundational Equations

### Schrödinger Equation
The time-dependent and time-independent Schrödinger equations are fundamental to quantum mechanics, describing how the quantum state (wave function) of a physical system changes over time.

### Planck's Equation
E = hf, where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, and f is frequency. This equation relates the energy of a photon to its frequency.

## Applications

- **Electronics**: Semiconductors and transistors rely on quantum behavior
- **Lasers**: Quantum emission principles enable laser technology
- **Nuclear Energy**: Nuclear reactions and decay processes
- **Medical Imaging**: PET scans utilize quantum principles
- **Quantum Computing**: Uses quantum bits (qubits) that exploit superposition and entanglement

## Classical vs Quantum Mechanics

| Aspect | Classical | Quantum |

## Conclusion
Quantum physics revolutionized our understanding of the microscopic world and has led to technological innovations that shape modern life. Despite its counterintuitive nature, quantum mechanics has proven to be one of the most accurate and successful theories in science.
