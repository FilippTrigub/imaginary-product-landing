# Quantum Physics Overview

## Introduction

Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. It represents a paradigm shift from classical physics and has revolutionized our understanding of the physical world.

## Key Principles

### Wave-Particle Duality
Matter and energy exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This dual nature is fundamental to quantum mechanics and was demonstrated through experiments like the double-slit experiment.

### Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that certain pairs of physical properties (like position and momentum) cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision. The more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be known.

### Quantum Superposition
Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured or observed. This is famously illustrated by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, where a cat in a box can be considered both alive and dead until observed.

### Quantum Entanglement
When particles become entangled, their quantum states become correlated in ways that persist even when separated by large distances. Measuring one particle instantaneously affects the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them.

## Applications

Quantum physics has led to numerous technological advances:

- **Semiconductors and transistors** - Foundation of modern electronics
- **Lasers** - Used in communications, medicine, and manufacturing
- **Quantum computing** - Emerging technology for processing information
- **Medical imaging** - MRI and PET scans
- **Cryptography** - Quantum key distribution for secure communications

## Significance

Quantum physics challenges our classical intuitions about reality and has profound implications for philosophy and our understanding of the universe. It remains one of the most successful theories in science, with predictions verified to extraordinary precision.
