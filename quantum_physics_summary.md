# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at the most fundamental level. It aims to uncover the properties and behaviors of the very building blocks of nature.

While classical physics deals with the macroscopic world, quantum physics reveals a world where particles don't behave as we would expect. Key concepts in quantum physics include:

*   **Quantization:** Physical quantities like energy exist in discrete "packets" or "quanta".
*   **Wave-Particle Duality:** Particles can exhibit characteristics of both particles and waves.
*   **Superposition:** Particles can exist in multiple states at once until measured.
*   **Entanglement:** Two or more particles can be linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, no matter the distance separating them.
*   **Uncertainty Principle:** There's a fundamental limit to how well we can know certain pairs of properties of a particle, like its position and momentum.

Quantum physics has led to many technological advancements, including semiconductors, lasers, and MRI machines. It's also the foundation for emerging technologies like quantum computing and quantum cryptography.
