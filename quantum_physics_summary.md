# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics, the foundation of quantum mechanics, describes the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales, where classical physics fails. Its key concepts include **quantization**, where properties like energy and momentum exist only in discrete values; **wave-particle duality**, meaning entities like electrons exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behavior; the **uncertainty principle**, which limits the precision with which certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) can be simultaneously known; **quantum superposition**, allowing systems to exist in multiple states at once until measured; **quantum entanglement**, where particles become linked such that the state of one instantly influences the other, regardless of distance; and **quantum tunneling**, enabling particles to pass through energy barriers that would be insurmountable classically. These phenomena, governed by probabilistic laws and described mathematically by wave functions and operators, underpin technologies like semiconductors, lasers, and quantum computing.
