# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics is the study of nature at the smallest scales—atoms, subatomic particles, and the fundamental fabric of reality. It forms the foundation for modern technologies like lasers, computers, smartphones, and MRI machines.

## Key Concepts

### Wave-Particle Duality
Particles like electrons and photons can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on how they are observed.

### Superposition
Quantum particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until they are measured—a famous example being Schrödinger's cat, which is both alive and dead until observed.

### Quantum Entanglement
Particles can become "entangled" such that measuring one instantly influences the other, regardless of distance. Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance."

### Decoherence
A key area of research by physicist Wojciech Zurek, decoherence explains how quantum systems transition to classical behavior through interaction with their environment.

## Historical Context
Quantum physics emerged in the early 20th century when classical physics couldn't explain phenomena like blackbody radiation. Pioneers like Planck, Bohr, Heisenberg, and Schrödinger developed the new framework.

## Modern Significance
Quantum physics enables:
- Semiconductor technology
- Lasers
- MRI imaging
- Quantum computing (emerging)

## Recent Developments (2026)
Recent work on decoherence and Quantum Darwinism aims to bridge the gap between quantum and classical physics, potentially resolving long-standing mysteries about how observable reality emerges from quantum theory.
