# Summary of Quantum Physics

Quantum physics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

Key concepts in quantum physics include:

* **Quantization:** Certain physical properties like energy can only take on discrete values.
* **Wave-particle duality:** Particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
* **Uncertainty principle:** It is impossible to simultaneously know certain pairs of physical properties, such as the position and momentum of a particle, with perfect accuracy.
* **Superposition:** A quantum system can be in multiple states at the same time until it is measured.
* **Entanglement:** Two or more quantum particles can be linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, regardless of the distance separating them.
