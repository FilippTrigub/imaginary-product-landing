# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. It represents one of the most fundamental theories in modern physics.

## Key Principles

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
Matter and energy exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This dual nature is fundamental to understanding quantum phenomena.

### 2. Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that certain pairs of physical properties (like position and momentum) cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision.

### 3. Quantum Superposition
Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until they are measured or observed, at which point they "collapse" into a definite state.

### 4. Quantum Entanglement
Particles can become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle instantaneously influences the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them.

## Applications

- **Quantum Computing**: Leveraging superposition and entanglement for computational power
- **Semiconductors**: Understanding electron behavior in materials
- **Medical Imaging**: Technologies like MRI rely on quantum principles
- **Cryptography**: Quantum key distribution for secure communication
- **Laser Technology**: Based on quantum mechanical principles of light emission

## Historical Context

Quantum physics emerged in the early 20th century through the work of pioneers including:
- Max Planck (quantum theory foundation)
- Albert Einstein (photoelectric effect)
- Niels Bohr (atomic model)
- Werner Heisenberg (uncertainty principle)
- Erwin Schrödinger (wave equation)

## Significance

Quantum physics fundamentally changed our understanding of nature and continues to drive technological innovation across multiple fields.
