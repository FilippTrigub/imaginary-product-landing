# Summary of Quantum Physics

Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

Here are some key concepts:

*   **Quanta:** Energy and matter exist in discrete units called quanta. For example, light is made up of particles called photons.
*   **Wave-Particle Duality:** Particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
*   **Superposition:** A particle can exist in multiple states at the same time. It is only when a measurement is made that the particle collapses into a single state.
*   **Entanglement:** Two or more particles can be linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, no matter how far apart they are.
*   **Uncertainty Principle:** It is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle with perfect accuracy. The more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known.

Quantum physics has led to many technological advancements, including lasers, transistors, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is also a key component in the development of new technologies such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography.
