# Quantum Physics Summary

Based on information from Wikipedia, here are the key concepts of quantum mechanics:

## Key Concepts

* **Wave-particle duality**: Particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on how they're observed (e.g. in the double-slit experiment)

* **Uncertainty principle**: There's a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of properties (like position and momentum) can be known simultaneously - the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known

* **Superposition**: Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until a measurement is made, at which point the wave function collapses to a specific state

* **Quantization**: In quantum systems, properties like energy, momentum, and angular momentum can only take on discrete values rather than continuous ranges (unlike classical physics)

* **Entanglement**: When particles interact, their quantum properties become intertwined and they remain connected even when separated by large distances (despite misconceptions, this doesn't allow faster-than-light communication)

* **Probability-driven outcomes**: Quantum mechanics predicts the probability of outcomes rather than definitive results - it uses probability amplitudes calculated from complex numbers (the Born rule)

* **Wave function**: A mathematical function that encodes all possible information about a quantum system and its probability distributions for various measurements

* **Quantum tunneling**: Particles can pass through energy barriers that would be impossible to cross according to classical mechanics (has applications in technology and stellar fusion)
