# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is the fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. It represents one of the most significant scientific developments of the 20th century.

## Key Principles

### Wave-Particle Duality
Matter and energy exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. Electrons, photons, and other quantum entities can behave as waves in some experiments and as particles in others, depending on how they are observed.

### Quantum Superposition
A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. This principle suggests that particles exist in all possible states at once, with probabilities assigned to each state, until an observation collapses the system into a definite state.

### Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
There is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be simultaneously known. Most famously, the more precisely you know a particle's position, the less precisely you can know its momentum, and vice versa.

### Quantum Entanglement
When particles become entangled, the quantum state of one particle instantaneously affects the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them. This phenomenon has been experimentally verified and forms the basis for emerging quantum technologies.

## Applications

### Quantum Computing
Leveraging superposition and entanglement to perform computations that would be impractical for classical computers.

### Quantum Cryptography
Using quantum principles to create theoretically unbreakable encryption methods.

### Semiconductors and Electronics
Modern electronics rely on quantum mechanical principles governing electron behavior in materials.

### Medical Imaging
Technologies like MRI scanners utilize quantum properties of atomic nuclei.

## Significance
Quantum physics has revolutionized our understanding of the universe at its most fundamental level and continues to drive technological innovation. It challenges classical intuitions about reality while providing the framework for cutting-edge research in physics, chemistry, and engineering.
