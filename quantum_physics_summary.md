# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics describes the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales, where classical physics fails. Key concepts include:

- **Quantization**: Properties like energy and momentum exist in discrete, not continuous, values.
- **Wave-particle duality**: Particles (e.g., electrons) exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behavior.
- **Uncertainty principle**: Certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot be precisely known simultaneously.
- **Superposition**: Quantum systems can exist in multiple states at once until measured.
- **Entanglement**: Particles can become linked, with the state of one instantly influencing another, regardless of distance.
- **Probabilistic outcomes**: Measurements yield probabilities (via the Born rule), not certainties.

These principles underpin technologies like semiconductors, lasers, and quantum computing.
