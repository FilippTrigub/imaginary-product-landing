# Quantum Physics — Quick Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics (or quantum mechanics) is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales (atoms, electrons, photons). It replaces classical intuitions with probabilistic rules and discrete, quantized quantities.

## Core Concepts
- **Quantization**: Physical quantities (like energy) can take only discrete values.
- **Wave–particle duality**: Particles can exhibit wave-like and particle-like behavior.
- **Superposition**: A system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.
- **Uncertainty principle**: Certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot both be known precisely.
- **Measurement and collapse**: Observation affects the system, leading to a single outcome from many possibilities.

## Why It Matters
Quantum physics underpins technologies such as semiconductors, lasers, MRI, and quantum computing. It also challenges classical notions of reality, causality, and determinism.
