# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

## Key Concepts

1. **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
2. **Quantization**: Certain properties, such as energy, are quantized, meaning they can only take on discrete values.
3. **Uncertainty Principle**: It is impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle.
4. **Superposition**: A quantum system can exist in multiple states at once until it is measured.
5. **Entanglement**: Particles can become entangled, meaning the state of one particle is dependent on the state of another, no matter the distance between them.

## Applications

Quantum physics has led to the development of technologies such as:
- Lasers
- Transistors
- Quantum computing
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

## History

Quantum mechanics was developed in the early 20th century by scientists such as Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrödinger.
