# Quantum Physics: Fundamental Principles, Key Concepts, and Applications

## Fundamental Principles
Quantum physics is the branch of science that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales—atoms and subatomic particles. It departs from classical physics with these core principles:

1. **Quantization**: Certain properties, like energy and angular momentum, exist in discrete units called *quanta* rather than continuous values.
2. **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles (e.g., electrons, photons) exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
3. **Uncertainty Principle**: Proposed by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision.
4. **Superposition**: Particles can exist in multiple states at once until measured.
5. **Entanglement**: When particles become entangled, the state of one instantaneously influences the state of another, regardless of distance.

## Key Concepts

- **Schrödinger's Equation**: Describes how quantum systems evolve over time, predicting the probability distribution of a particle's position.
- **Quantum States**: Represented by *wavefunctions*, which encode all measurable information about a system.
- **Collapse of the Wavefunction**: Measurement forces a quantum system to "choose" a definite state from its superposition.
- **Tunneling**: Particles can pass through energy barriers they classically shouldn't, enabling processes like nuclear fusion in stars.

## Real-World Applications

1. **Electronics**: Transistors rely on quantum mechanics (e.g., semiconductor physics).
2. **Quantum Computing**: Uses qubits to perform calculations exponentially faster than classical computers for specific problems.
3. **Medical Imaging**: MRI machines use quantum principles (nuclear magnetic resonance).
4. **Lasers**: Operate on quantum principles, enabling applications in surgery, communications, and manufacturing.
5. **Cryptography**: Quantum key distribution (QKD) leverages entanglement to create theoretically unhackable encryption.
6. **Materials Science**: Quantum mechanics explains superconductivity and enables the design of advanced materials like graphene.

Quantum physics underpins much of modern technology and continues to drive innovations in computing, communication, and fundamental science.
