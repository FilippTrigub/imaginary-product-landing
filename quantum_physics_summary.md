# Quantum Physics Summary

## What is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics is the scientific study of the behavior of light particles (photons), electrons, atoms, and other tiny objects at the atomic and subatomic level.

## Key Concepts

### Wave-Particle Duality
Micro-objects behave both as particles and as waves depending on how we observe them (set up the experiment).

### Quantization
Energy (for example, of light or heat) is absorbed and emitted not as a continuous stream, but in small indivisible portions called **quanta**.

### Probability & Uncertainty
In the microworld, it's impossible to determine exactly where a particle is located and how fast it's moving. One can only calculate the probability of detecting it in a particular place or state. Additionally, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that it's impossible to measure with absolute precision a pair of interrelated quantities simultaneously (e.g., position and momentum).

### Quantum Entanglement
Two or more particles can be connected so closely that changing the state of one instantly affects the state of another, even if they are separated by enormous distances. Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance."

## Schrödinger Equation

The Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. Solutions to this equation give wavefunctions, which have a probabilistic interpretation.
