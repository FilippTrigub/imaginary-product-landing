# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics is a fundamental theory describing the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales, where classical physics breaks down. It explores the universe's smallest building blocks like atoms, electrons, and photons.

## Key Concepts

*   **Quantization and Discrete States:** Physical quantities exist in discrete "packets" or "quanta" (e.g., electron energy levels).
*   **Wave-Particle Duality:** Quantum objects exhibit both wave and particle characteristics.
*   **Superposition:** A particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.
*   **Entanglement:** Interconnected particles instantly influence each other, regardless of distance.
*   **Uncertainty Principle:** There are limits to precisely knowing certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum).
*   **Wave Function:** A mathematical description of a particle's possible states and probabilities.
*   **Spin:** A fundamental characteristic of elementary particles.

## Historical Development

Emerging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries:
*   **Max Planck (1900):** Introduced energy quantization to solve the black-body radiation problem.
*   **Albert Einstein (1905):** Explained the photoelectric effect with photons.
*   **Niels Bohr (1913):** Applied quantization to the hydrogen atom.
*   **Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Pascual Jordan, Erwin Schrödinger, Paul Dirac:** Further developed quantum mechanics.

## Modern Applications

Quantum physics is the foundation of much modern technology:
*   **Electronics:** Semiconductors, transistors, LEDs, lasers.
*   **Medical Imaging:** MRI machines.
*   **Navigation:** GPS systems using atomic clocks.
*   **Quantum Computing:** Harnesses superposition and entanglement for advanced computations.
*   **Quantum Cryptography:** Secure communication channels.
*   **Other:** Electron microscopes, solar cells, quantum dots, understanding chemical bonding and biological processes.
