# Quantum Physics Summary

## Introduction

Quantum physics is a fundamental branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. It represents a radical departure from classical physics and has revolutionized our understanding of the physical world.

## Key Concepts

### Wave-Particle Duality
Particles such as electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, depending on how they are observed. This dual nature is one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics.

### Quantum Superposition
Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured or observed. This principle is exemplified by Schrödinger's famous thought experiment involving a cat that is both alive and dead until observed.

### Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that certain pairs of physical properties (like position and momentum) cannot both be known to arbitrary precision simultaneously. The more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be known.

### Quantum Entanglement
When particles become entangled, the quantum state of one particle becomes dependent on the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."

## Applications

Quantum physics has led to numerous technological advances including:
- Semiconductor technology and transistors
- Lasers and optical communications
- Quantum computing
- Medical imaging technologies (MRI, PET scans)
- Atomic clocks and GPS systems

## Conclusion

Quantum physics continues to challenge our classical intuitions about reality while providing the foundation for modern technology and ongoing research into the nature of the universe.
