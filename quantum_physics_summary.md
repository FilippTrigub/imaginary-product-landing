# Quantum Physics

Quantum physics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

## Key Concepts

*   **Quantization:** In quantum mechanics, certain physical properties like energy are quantized, meaning they can only take on discrete values.
*   **Wave-particle duality:** This principle states that every particle or quantum entity may be described as either a particle or a wave.
*   **Uncertainty principle:** This principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg, states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, such as position and momentum, can be known.
*   **Quantum superposition:** This principle states that any two (or more) quantum states can be added together ("superposed") and the result will be another valid quantum state.
*   **Quantum entanglement:** This is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a pair or group of particles is generated, interacts, or shares spatial proximity in such a way that the quantum state of each particle of the pair or group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance.
