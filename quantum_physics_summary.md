# Summary of Quantum Physics

Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. It emerged in the early 20th century, with key contributions from scientists like Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Erwin Schrödinger, and Werner Heisenberg.

## Key Concepts

*   **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles can exhibit properties of both waves and particles.
*   **Superposition**: A particle can exist in multiple states or locations at the same time.
*   **Entanglement**: Two or more particles can be linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, no matter how far apart they are.
*   **Quantization**: Energy and other properties of particles are not continuous but come in discrete packets called "quanta."
*   **Uncertainty Principle**: It is impossible to simultaneously know certain pairs of properties of a particle with perfect accuracy, such as its position and momentum.

## Applications

Quantum physics is the foundation for many modern technologies, including:

*   **Lasers**: Used in everything from CD players to medical surgery.
*   **Semiconductors**: The basis of all modern electronics, including computers and smartphones.
*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: A medical imaging technique used to visualize internal body structures.
*   **Quantum Computing**: A new type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena to perform calculations.
*   **Quantum Cryptography**: A method of secure communication that uses the principles of quantum mechanics.

Quantum physics has revolutionized our understanding of the universe and continues to be an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to develop new technologies and further explore the mysteries of the quantum realm.
