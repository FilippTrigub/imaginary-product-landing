# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics (quantum mechanics) explains how energy, matter, and information behave at atomic and subatomic scales. It introduces quantization—the idea that properties such as energy come in discrete packets—breaking with classical continuity. The theory treats particles as wavefunctions that interfere and exhibit phenomena like superposition and tunneling, captured mathematically by the Schrödinger equation.

Key principles include the probabilistic interpretation of measurement outcomes, Heisenberg's uncertainty relation limiting simultaneous knowledge of conjugate quantities, and entanglement, where separated systems share correlated states. Quantum field theory extends these ideas to treat particles as excitations of underlying fields, enabling the Standard Model of particle physics.

Technological impacts range from semiconductors and lasers to emerging quantum information sciences such as quantum computing, communication, and sensing.
