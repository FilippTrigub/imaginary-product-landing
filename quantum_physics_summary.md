# Key Concepts of Quantum Physics

Quantum physics, or quantum mechanics, is the fundamental theory describing the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales. Unlike classical physics, which predicts precise outcomes, quantum mechanics deals in probabilities—offering only the likelihood of various possible results. This probabilistic nature arises from the wave function, a mathematical entity encoding probability amplitudes; the square of its magnitude gives the probability density for finding a particle in a particular state, per the Born rule.

Central to quantum theory are several non-classical phenomena. **Wave-particle duality** reveals that entities like electrons and photons exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties, famously demonstrated by the double-slit experiment. The **uncertainty principle** establishes fundamental limits on simultaneously knowing certain pairs of properties, such as position and momentum. **Quantum superposition** allows particles to exist in multiple states at once until measured, while **quantum entanglement** links particles so that the state of one instantly influences another, regardless of distance—though this cannot transmit information faster than light. Additionally, **quantum tunneling** enables particles to pass through energy barriers that would be insurmountable according to classical physics.

These counterintuitive principles have been experimentally verified with extraordinary precision and underpin modern technologies like semiconductors, lasers, MRI machines, and quantum computers. While quantum mechanics departs radically from classical intuition, it reduces to classical physics in the macroscopic limit (the correspondence principle), ensuring consistency with everyday experience. Despite its predictive power, the interpretation of quantum mechanics—particularly the nature of measurement and wave function collapse—remains a subject of deep philosophical debate.
