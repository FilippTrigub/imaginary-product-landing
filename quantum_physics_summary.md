# Quantum Physics: A Beginner's Summary

## What is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics is the branch of science that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales—atoms, subatomic particles, and the fundamental building blocks of reality. It describes a reality far stranger than our everyday experiences suggest.

## Key Concepts

### Wave-Particle Duality
Particles like electrons and photons can behave both as waves and as particles, depending on how they are observed.

### Superposition
Quantum particles can exist in multiple states at once until they are observed. This is famously illustrated by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment—a cat that is both alive and dead until observed.

### Quantum Entanglement
Particles can be "entangled" such that measuring one instantly influences the other, regardless of distance. Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance."

### Quantum Tunneling
Particles can pass through barriers that classical physics would deem impenetrable.

## Why Quantum Physics Matters

Without quantum physics, we wouldn't have:
- Lasers
- Computers
- Smartphones
- MRI machines
- Transistors

## Learning Resources

- **MIT OpenCourseWare**: Free quantum physics courses from MIT
- **Khan Academy**: Introductory quantum physics tutorials
- **The Quantum Cat**: Free physics learning resources (2026 edition)

Quantum physics, while counterintuitive, is the foundation of modern technology and our understanding of the universe.
