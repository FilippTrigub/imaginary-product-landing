# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at the most fundamental level, exploring the behavior of the universe's smallest building blocks like atoms, electrons, and photons.

## Key Concepts

### Superposition
- Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed
- This counterintuitive behavior is fundamental to quantum mechanics

### Entanglement
- Two particles can be mysteriously linked across vast distances
- What happens to one instantly affects the other, regardless of separation

### Wave-Particle Duality
- Light and matter exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties
- This dual nature was a revolutionary discovery in early 1900s

### Probability and Uncertainty
- Quantum mechanics is fundamentally probabilistic
- We can only calculate likelihoods, not certainties

## Origins and Impact
- Emerged in late 1800s/early 1900s from experiments that defied classical physics
- Led to technologies like lasers, transistors, and quantum computers
- Applications span materials, chemistry, biology, and astronomy

## Everyday Relevance
While often associated with tiny particles, quantum phenomena affect all scales of matter and energy, though they're harder to detect in larger objects.
