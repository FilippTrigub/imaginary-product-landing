# Quantum Physics Summary

## Basic Principles

Quantum mechanics is the fundamental physical theory that describes the behavior of matter and light at atomic and subatomic scales.

### Key Concepts:
- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles exhibit both particle and wave characteristics depending on how they're observed
- **Quantization**: Physical quantities (energy, momentum, angular momentum) are restricted to discrete values
- **Uncertainty Principle**: Limits to precision in simultaneous measurement of conjugate variables (position/momentum, energy/time)
- **Superposition**: Systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured
- **Entanglement**: Particles become correlated such that the state of one instantly influences the other
- **Probability**: Results are inherently probabilistic, not deterministic

## Applications

Quantum mechanics is essential to understanding and developing:
- Chemistry: Chemical bonding, molecular structures, reaction mechanisms
- Electronics: Transistors, semiconductors, microprocessors
- Optics: Lasers, LEDs, optical amplifiers
- Medicine: MRI, electron microscopy
- Quantum Computing: Future computational systems leveraging superposition and entanglement
- Cryptography: Quantum key distribution for secure communication
- Materials Science: Superconductors, novel materials with quantum properties

## Historical Development

### Early Foundations (1900-1920):
- 1900: Max Planck introduces the concept of energy quanta to explain black-body radiation
- 1905: Einstein explains the photoelectric effect using light quanta (photons)
- 1913: Niels Bohr develops model of hydrogen atom with quantized energy levels
- 1924: Louis de Broglie proposes matter waves (particles can behave as waves)

### Full Development (1920s):
- 1925: Heisenberg develops matrix mechanics
- 1926: Schrödinger creates wave mechanics and proves equivalence with matrix form
- 1926: Born establishes the probabilistic interpretation of the wave function
- Mid-1920s: Copenhagen interpretation emerges from Bohr and Heisenberg
