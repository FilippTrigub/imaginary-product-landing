# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics is a foundational science that explores matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels, where classical physics principles no longer apply. It emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to explain phenomena like black-body radiation and the photoelectric effect.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Wave-particle duality:** Light and matter exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
*   **Quantization:** Energy, momentum, and angular momentum exist in discrete packets called "quanta."
*   **Superposition:** A quantum object can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.
*   **Entanglement:** Particles become linked, and the state of one instantly affects the others, regardless of distance.
*   **Uncertainty Principle:** It's impossible to precisely know certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) of a particle simultaneously.

## Applications:

Quantum physics is crucial for modern technology, forming the basis for:
*   Lasers
*   Semiconductors (smartphones, computers)
*   MRI machines
*   GPS systems
*   Understanding chemical interactions at the molecular level.
