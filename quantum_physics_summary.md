# Key Concepts of Quantum Physics

Quantum physics is the fundamental theory describing the behavior of matter and light at atomic and subatomic scales. Below are its essential concepts:

## Core Principles

- **Quantization**: Physical properties (energy, momentum, angular momentum) exist in discrete, quantized values rather than continuous ranges
- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Quantum entities exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties depending on the experimental context
- **Probability & Uncertainty**: Outcomes are inherently probabilistic; the exact state cannot be predicted with certainty, only probabilities
- **Superposition**: Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured

## Fundamental Phenomena

- **Uncertainty Principle**: Certain pairs of properties (like position and momentum) cannot be precisely known simultaneously
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Particles can become correlated such that the state of one instantly influences another, regardless of distance
- **Quantum Tunneling**: Particles can pass through energy barriers that would be impossible to cross according to classical physics
- **Quantum Interference**: Probability amplitudes can constructively or destructively interfere, as demonstrated in the double-slit experiment

## Mathematical Framework

- **Wave Function**: Mathematical description containing all information about a quantum system
- **Schrödinger Equation**: Governs how quantum states evolve over time deterministically
- **Born Rule**: The probability of finding a particle is given by the square of the wave function's amplitude
- **Measurement Collapse**: Upon measurement, the wave function "collapses" to a definite state

## Applications & Impact

Quantum physics underpins modern technologies including semiconductors, lasers, MRI machines, and is foundational to emerging fields like quantum computing and quantum cryptography. It has been experimentally verified to extraordinary precision, with quantum electrodynamics (QED) predictions matching experiments to 1 part in 10¹².
