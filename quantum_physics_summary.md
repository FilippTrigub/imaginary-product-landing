# Quantum Physics: Fundamental Principles

## Key Concepts in Quantum Mechanics

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
- Particles (e.g., electrons, photons) exhibit both **wave-like** and **particle-like** properties.
- Demonstrated by experiments like the **double-slit experiment**, where particles create interference patterns like waves.

### 2. Quantization
- Certain properties, such as energy, angular momentum, and spin, are **quantized**—they can only take discrete values.
- Example: Electrons in an atom occupy specific energy levels (quantized states).

### 3. Uncertainty Principle (Heisenberg)
- It is impossible to simultaneously know certain pairs of properties (e.g., **position and momentum**) with perfect accuracy.
- Mathematically: `Δx · Δp ≥ ħ/2`, where `Δx` = position uncertainty, `Δp` = momentum uncertainty, and `ħ` = reduced Planck constant.

### 4. Superposition
- A quantum system can exist in multiple states at once until measured.
- Example: Schrödinger’s cat (a thought experiment) is both alive and dead until observed.
- Represented mathematically by a **wavefunction** (`ψ`), which collapses upon measurement.

### 5. Entanglement
- Particles can become **entangled**, meaning the state of one particle is instantly correlated with another, regardless of distance.
- Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance."
- Basis for quantum computing and cryptography.

### 6. Wavefunction and Probability
- The **wavefunction (`ψ`)** describes the quantum state of a system.
- The square of its amplitude (`|ψ|²`) gives the **probability density** of finding a particle in a given state.
- Measurement causes the wavefunction to **collapse** to a definite state.

### 7. Schrödinger Equation
- Governs the time evolution of quantum systems.
- Time-dependent form:
  `iħ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥ ψ`, where `Ĥ` = Hamiltonian operator (energy of the system).

### 8. Quantum Tunneling
- Particles can pass through energy barriers they classically shouldn’t be able to.
- Essential for nuclear fusion in stars and technologies like scanning tunneling microscopes.

### 9. Pauli Exclusion Principle
- No two identical **fermions** (e.g., electrons) can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.
- Explains electron shell structure in atoms and the stability of matter.

### 10. Quantum Decoherence
- Interaction with the environment causes a quantum system to lose its superposition and behave classically.
- Key challenge for building **quantum computers**.

## Fundamental Implications
- **Non-locality**: Quantum mechanics is inherently probabilistic and non-deterministic.
- **Measurement problem**: The role of observation in collapsing the wavefunction remains debated.
- **Applications**: Quantum computing, cryptography, lasers, and semiconductors rely on these principles.
