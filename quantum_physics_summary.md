# Quantum Physics (Quantum Mechanics) — Summary

## Overview
- Quantum mechanics is the fundamental physical theory describing the behavior of matter and light at atomic and subatomic scales. It is the foundation of quantum physics and supports fields such as quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, and quantum information science.
- Classical physics works well at macroscopic scales, but it cannot fully describe phenomena at very small (atomic/subatomic) scales. Classical mechanics can be derived as an approximation of quantum mechanics for ordinary scales.

## Core Concepts
- **Quantization:** Energy, momentum, and angular momentum appear in discrete values rather than continuous ranges.
- **Wave–particle duality:** Quantum systems exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behavior.
- **Uncertainty:** There are limits on how precisely certain pairs of physical properties can be known simultaneously.

## Historical Development
- Early 1900s: Max Planck’s work on black-body radiation and Albert Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect established key ideas.
- 1920s: Full development of quantum mechanics by pioneers such as Niels Bohr and others.

## Applications
- Enables calculation of properties and behavior of microscopic systems (atoms, molecules, subatomic particles).
- Validated experimentally across many domains; modern technologies (e.g., semiconductors, lasers) depend on quantum principles.
