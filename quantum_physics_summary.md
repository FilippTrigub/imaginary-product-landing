# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. It represents one of the most fundamental theories in modern physics and has revolutionized our understanding of nature.

## Key Principles

### Wave-Particle Duality
Matter and energy exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This dual nature is fundamental to quantum mechanics and challenges classical intuitions about the nature of reality.

### Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that certain pairs of physical properties (such as position and momentum) cannot be simultaneously known with arbitrary precision. The more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be known.

### Superposition
Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until they are measured or observed. This principle is central to quantum computing and quantum information theory.

### Quantum Entanglement
When particles become entangled, the quantum state of one particle cannot be described independently of the others, even when separated by large distances. Einstein famously referred to this as "spooky action at a distance."

## Applications

### Modern Technology
- Semiconductors and transistors
- Lasers and LED technology
- Medical imaging (MRI, PET scans)
- Solar cells and photovoltaics

### Emerging Fields
- Quantum computing
- Quantum cryptography
- Quantum sensors and metrology
- Quantum communication networks

## Significance
Quantum physics has fundamentally changed our understanding of the universe and continues to drive technological innovation. It challenges our classical notions of reality and has profound philosophical implications about the nature of observation, measurement, and determinism.
