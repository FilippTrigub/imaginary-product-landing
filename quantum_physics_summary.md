# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics is a fundamental branch of science that studies matter and energy at the smallest scales (atoms, electrons, photons). It developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to explain phenomena that classical physics could not.

Key concepts include:

*   **Quanta:** Matter and energy exist in discrete packets with a minimum associated value. For example, light energy comes in photons.
*   **Wave-Particle Duality:** Light and matter can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on how they are observed.
*   **Superposition:** An object can exist in multiple possible states simultaneously.
*   **Quantized States:** Particles in bound quantum systems can only have specific, discrete values for properties like energy or momentum. Electrons in atoms, for instance, occupy distinct energy levels.
*   **Electron Orbitals:** These are mathematical descriptions of the probability of an electron's location within an atom. Electrons can jump between orbitals by gaining or losing energy.

Quantum physics is essential for modern technology, underpinning lasers, semiconductors (used in smartphones and computers), MRI machines, and GPS systems.
