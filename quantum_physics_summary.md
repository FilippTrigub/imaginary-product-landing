# Quantum Physics: A Summary

## What Is Quantum Physics?

Quantum physics is the branch of science that explores the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales — atoms, electrons, and photons. Unlike classical physics, particles at this scale follow a fundamentally different set of rules that often defy everyday intuition.

## Key Principles

- **Superposition**: A particle can exist in multiple states or places simultaneously until it is observed or measured.
- **Entanglement**: Two particles can become linked so that measuring one instantly influences the other, regardless of the distance between them — what Einstein called "spooky action at a distance."
- **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: It is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle. This is not a limitation of instruments but a fundamental property of nature.
- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Matter and light exhibit properties of both particles and waves.
- **Quantization**: Energy exists in discrete packets ("quanta") rather than as a continuous spectrum.

## Historical Milestones

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **1900** | Max Planck proposed that energy comes in discrete packets called "quanta," launching quantum theory. |
| **1905** | Albert Einstein explained the photoelectric effect, showing light behaves as both a wave and a particle. |
| **1913** | Niels Bohr introduced his model of the atom with quantized electron orbits, producing the famous Bohr formula. |
| **1925** | Werner Heisenberg developed matrix mechanics, the first rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics. |
| **1926** | Erwin Schrödinger developed wave mechanics and his celebrated wave equation. Heisenberg showed the two formulations are mathematically equivalent. |
| **1927** | Heisenberg formulated the Uncertainty Principle. Bohr and Heisenberg developed the Copenhagen interpretation. |
| **1935** | Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen described entanglement in the famous EPR paradox paper. |
| **1961** | Claus Jönsson performed the double-slit experiment with electrons, confirming wave-particle duality for massive particles. |

## Why It Matters

Quantum physics is the foundation of much modern technology:

- **Lasers** — used in communications, medicine, and manufacturing.
- **Semiconductors** — the chips powering smartphones, computers, and virtually all electronics.
- **MRI machines** — medical imaging relying on quantum spin properties.
- **GPS systems** — dependent on precision atomic clocks governed by quantum mechanics.

## The Future of Quantum

Emerging quantum technologies promise transformative advances:

- **Quantum Computing** — solving problems intractable for classical supercomputers.
- **Quantum Networking** — enabling fundamentally secure communications via quantum cryptography.
- **Quantum Sensors** — ultra-sensitive measurement devices for medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and navigation.
- **Advanced Materials** — discovery of novel materials with unprecedented properties through quantum simulation.
