# Summary of Quantum Physics

Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

Here are some key concepts:

*   **Superposition:** A particle can be in multiple states at once. For example, an electron can be in multiple locations at the same time.
*   **Entanglement:** Two or more quantum particles can be linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, no matter how far apart they are.
*   **Wave-particle duality:** Quantum objects have both wave-like and particle-like properties. For example, light can behave as both a wave and a particle.
*   **Quantization:** Certain physical properties, such as energy, can only take on discrete values.

Quantum mechanics has led to the development of many technologies, including lasers, transistors, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is also essential for understanding the fundamental nature of reality.
