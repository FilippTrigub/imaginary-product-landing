# Quantum Physics: A Summary

Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at the most fundamental level, describing the behavior of nature's building blocks — atoms, electrons, photons, and other subatomic particles. Developed in the late 1800s and early 1900s, it arose from experimental observations that could not be explained by classical physics.

## Key Principles

### Wave-Particle Duality
Quantum objects exhibit both particle-like properties (mass, charge, energy) and wave-like properties (wavelength, frequency). The famous **double-slit experiment** demonstrates this: electrons and photons produce interference patterns characteristic of waves, yet are detected as individual particles.

### Superposition
A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until a measurement is made. An electron, for example, can pass through two slits at the same time, interfering with itself. Measurement **collapses** the superposition into a single definite state.

### Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that certain pairs of physical properties — such as position and momentum — cannot both be precisely known at the same time. The more accurately one is measured, the less precisely the other can be determined.

### Quantum Entanglement
When two or more particles become entangled, their properties are correlated regardless of the distance between them. Measuring one particle instantly constrains the properties of the other. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."

## Recent Developments (2025–2026)

- **Hidden quantum geometry**: Researchers discovered a quantum geometry inside materials that steers electrons, echoing how gravity warps light in space.
- **Quantum computing advances**: Stanford researchers created miniature optical cavities that could help quantum computers scale to millions of qubits.
- **Quantum internet progress**: Breakthroughs in teleporting information between photons from different quantum dots bring quantum communication closer to reality.
- **Phonon lasers**: Engineers created chip-scale devices generating tiny vibrations that could transform future electronics.
- **Dark matter research**: New theories suggest dark matter particles may have been born hot rather than cold, challenging long-held assumptions.

## Applications

Quantum physics underpins many modern technologies including lasers, transistors, MRI machines, and semiconductor electronics. Emerging applications include quantum computing, quantum cryptography, quantum sensing, and the development of a quantum internet.
