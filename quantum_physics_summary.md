# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at the most fundamental level. It seeks to understand the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels.

## Key Concepts

### Wave-Particle Duality
Particles like electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, depending on how they are observed.

### Superposition
Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. The famous thought experiment Schrödinger's cat illustrates this concept.

### Entanglement
Two or more particles can become "entangled" so that the quantum state of one particle is instantly correlated with the state of another, regardless of the distance between them.

### Quantum Tunneling
Particles can pass through barriers that classical physics would consider impenetrable, which is essential for technologies like semiconductors and nuclear fusion.

## Applications
- Quantum computing
- MRI machines
- Lasers
- Solar cells

## Current Research
Quantum physics continues to drive cutting-edge research in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication.
