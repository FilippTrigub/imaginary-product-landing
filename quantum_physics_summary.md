# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics (also called quantum mechanics) is the branch of physics that describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels, atoms, and subatomic particles. It provides the theoretical framework for understanding phenomena that classical physics cannot explain, such as discrete energy levels and probabilistic measurement outcomes.

## Core Principles
- **Wave–particle duality:** Particles such as electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.
- **Quantization:** Certain physical properties (like energy) take on discrete values rather than a continuous range.
- **Superposition:** A quantum system can exist in multiple states at the same time until measured.
- **Uncertainty principle:** There is a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) can be known simultaneously.
- **Measurement and collapse:** Observation affects the system, causing a probabilistic collapse from a superposition to a definite outcome.

## Key Concepts and Models
- **Schrödinger equation:** The foundational equation that governs how quantum systems evolve over time.
- **Quantum states and wavefunctions:** Mathematical representations of the probabilities for measurement outcomes.
- **Operators and observables:** Physical quantities are represented by operators acting on quantum states.

## Applications
- **Semiconductors and transistors:** The basis of modern electronics and computing.
- **Lasers:** Light amplification through stimulated emission.
- **MRI and medical imaging:** Exploits quantum properties of nuclei.
- **Quantum computing:** Uses quantum bits (qubits) and superposition to potentially solve certain problems faster.
