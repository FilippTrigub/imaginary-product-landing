# Quantum Physics Summary

## Overview
Quantum physics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. It fundamentally differs from classical physics by describing the probabilistic nature of particles and energy.

## Key Principles

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
Particles such as electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on how they are observed. This dual nature is central to quantum mechanics.

### 2. Uncertainty Principle
Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that certain pairs of physical properties (like position and momentum) cannot both be precisely measured simultaneously. The more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be known.

### 3. Quantum Superposition
A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured. Upon measurement, the system "collapses" into one of the possible states. This is famously illustrated by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.

### 4. Quantum Entanglement
When particles become entangled, the state of one particle is directly related to the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them. Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance."

### 5. Quantization
Energy, angular momentum, and other properties exist in discrete units called quanta, rather than continuous values. This is where the term "quantum" originates.

## Applications

- **Semiconductors and Electronics**: Modern computing relies on quantum mechanical principles
- **Lasers**: Based on quantum transitions in atoms
- **Medical Imaging**: MRI and PET scans use quantum principles
- **Quantum Computing**: Leverages superposition and entanglement for computational power
- **Cryptography**: Quantum key distribution for secure communications

## Historical Development

Quantum physics emerged in the early 20th century through the work of physicists including Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrödinger, revolutionizing our understanding of the microscopic world.
