# Quantum Physics Summary

## Introduction
Quantum physics is the fundamental theory in physics that describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles.

## Key Principles

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
- Quantum objects exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties
- Demonstrated by the famous double-slit experiment
- Electrons, photons, and other particles can behave as both waves and particles

### 2. Superposition
- Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously
- Only when measured does the system "collapse" into one definite state
- Schrödinger's cat thought experiment illustrates this concept

### 3. Quantum Entanglement
- Particles can become correlated in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently
- Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance"
- Forms the basis for quantum computing and quantum cryptography

### 4. Uncertainty Principle
- Formulated by Werner Heisenberg
- States that certain pairs of physical properties cannot both be known to arbitrary precision
- Position and momentum are the classic example

### 5. Quantization
- Energy comes in discrete packets called "quanta"
- Electrons in atoms can only occupy specific energy levels
- Explains atomic spectra and chemical properties

## Applications
- Quantum computing
- Quantum cryptography
- Medical imaging (MRI)
- Laser technology
- Semiconductor devices

## Conclusion
Quantum physics revolutionized our understanding of the universe at the microscopic scale and continues to drive technological innovation in the 21st century.
