# Key Concepts of Quantum Physics

Quantum physics (or quantum mechanics) is the fundamental theory describing the behavior of matter and light at atomic and subatomic scales. Below is a concise overview of its core principles:

## Core Principles

- **Quantization**: Physical properties (energy, momentum, angular momentum) exist in discrete, quantized values rather than continuous ranges.
- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. For example, light behaves as waves in interference experiments but as particles (photons) in the photoelectric effect.
- **Uncertainty Principle**: It's impossible to simultaneously know exact values of certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum). The more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known.
- **Superposition**: Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. A particle's state is described by a wave function representing probabilities of possible outcomes.
- **Entanglement**: Particles can become linked such that the state of one instantly influences the state of another, regardless of distance. This "spooky action at a distance" (Einstein) is a confirmed phenomenon.
- **Quantum Tunneling**: Particles can pass through energy barriers that would be impossible to surmount according to classical physics.

## Mathematical Framework

- **Wave Function (ψ)**: Describes the quantum state of a system. The square of its amplitude gives the probability density of finding a particle in a particular state (Born rule).
- **Schrödinger Equation**: Governs how the wave function evolves over time: *iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ*, where *Ĥ* is the Hamiltonian operator representing total energy.
- **Observables**: Physical quantities (position, momentum, etc.) are represented by Hermitian operators. Measurement yields eigenvalues of these operators.

## Key Implications

- **Probabilistic Nature**: Quantum mechanics predicts probabilities, not certainties (unlike classical physics).
- **Measurement Problem**: The act of measurement "collapses" the wave function from superposition to a definite state—a process still debated philosophically.
- **Non-locality**: Entanglement demonstrates that quantum systems can exhibit correlations that defy classical notions of locality.

## Historical Context

Developed in the early 20th century (Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, Dirac) to explain phenomena classical physics couldn't, such as black-body radiation and atomic spectra. It has been verified with extraordinary precision (e.g., quantum electrodynamics predictions match experiment to 1 part in 10¹²).

## Applications

- **Technology**: Transistors, lasers, MRI, semiconductors, and flash memory rely on quantum effects.
- **Emerging Fields**: Quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing exploit superposition and entanglement.
