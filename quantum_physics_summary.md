# Summary of Quantum Physics

Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. It provides a mathematical description of much of the dual particle-like and wave-like behavior and interactions of energy and matter.

## Key Concepts

*   **Wave-Particle Duality:** This principle suggests that particles can exhibit properties of both waves and particles.
*   **Quantization:** In the quantum world, many properties (like energy) are quantized, meaning they can only take on discrete values.
*   **Superposition:** A quantum system can be in multiple states at the same time. The state of a particle is described by a wave function, which represents the probability of finding the particle in a particular state.
*   **Entanglement:** This is a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles are linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, no matter how far apart they are.
*   **Uncertainty Principle:** Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, such as position and momentum, can be known simultaneously.

## Applications

Quantum mechanics has had a profound impact on technology. It is the foundation of many modern technologies, including:

*   Lasers
*   Transistors and semiconductors
*   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
*   Quantum computing
