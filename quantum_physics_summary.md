# Quantum Physics Summary

Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales—think atoms, electrons, photons, and subatomic particles.

## Key Concepts

1.  **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles like electrons can behave as both particles and waves.
2.  **Superposition**: A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.
3.  **Entanglement**: Two entangled particles can affect each other instantly, no matter the distance.
4.  **Uncertainty Principle**: It's impossible to know both a particle's position and momentum with perfect accuracy at the same time.
5.  **Quantization**: Energy comes in discrete packets called quanta.

## Applications

-   **Electronics**: Transistors in phones and computers.
-   **Lasers and LEDs**: Based on the stimulated emission of photons.
-   **MRI Machines**: Use nuclear magnetic resonance.
-   **Emerging Tech**: Quantum computing and quantum sensors.
