# Quantum Physics Summary

## Introduction
Quantum physics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. It fundamentally differs from classical physics in how it describes the nature of particles and their interactions.

## Key Principles

### Wave-Particle Duality
- Particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties
- Light can behave as both electromagnetic waves and discrete photons
- Matter particles like electrons also display wave characteristics

### Uncertainty Principle
- Formulated by Werner Heisenberg
- States that certain pairs of physical properties cannot be simultaneously known with arbitrary precision
- Most famously applies to position and momentum

### Superposition
- Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously
- The system only "collapses" into a definite state when observed or measured
- Foundation for quantum computing concepts

### Quantum Entanglement
- Particles can become correlated in ways that classical physics cannot explain
- Measuring one entangled particle instantly affects its partner, regardless of distance
- Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance"

## Applications
- Semiconductors and microelectronics
- Lasers and optical technologies
- Quantum computing and cryptography
- Medical imaging (MRI, PET scans)
- Nuclear energy

## Conclusion
Quantum physics revolutionized our understanding of the universe at its most fundamental level, challenging our classical intuitions and enabling technological advances that shape modern society.
