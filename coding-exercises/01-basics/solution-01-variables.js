// Solution 1: Variables

// Task 1: Create a variable called 'name' and assign it your name as a string
let name = 'Alice';

// Task 2: Create a variable called 'age' and assign it your age as a number
let age = 25;

// Task 3: Create a variable called 'isStudent' and assign it a boolean value
let isStudent = true;

// Task 4: Create a constant called 'birthYear' and assign it the year you were born
const birthYear = 1999;

// Task 5: Try to reassign a new value to 'birthYear'
// birthYear = 2000; // This would throw: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

// Task 6: Log all your variables to the console
console.log('Name:', name);
console.log('Age:', age);
console.log('Is Student:', isStudent);
console.log('Birth Year:', birthYear);

// Task 7: Create a variable without assigning a value, then assign a value later
let favoriteColor;
favoriteColor = 'blue';
console.log('Favorite Color:', favoriteColor);

// Task 8: Create variables for a person's information
let firstName = 'John';
let lastName = 'Doe';
let city = 'New York';
let country = 'USA';

console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName} lives in ${city}, ${country}`);

console.log('\n--- Exercise 1 Complete! ---');
