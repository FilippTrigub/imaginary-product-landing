NovaSphere Vision Statement
===========================

NovaSphere envisions a personal computing environment where holographic
interfaces blend with ambient intelligence to keep people focused on what
matters most. Every surface becomes an adaptive canvas, responding to voice,
gesture, and intent with fluid, latency-free feedback.

Guiding Principles
------------------
- Holograms should feel as tangible as physical tools.
- Privacy must be preserved through on-device inference and encryption.
- Interfaces adapt contextually, reducing cognitive load instead of adding
  menu clutter.
