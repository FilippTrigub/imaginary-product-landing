# Quantum Physics Summary

## Introduction

Quantum physics (or quantum mechanics) is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. Unlike classical physics which works well for large objects, quantum physics reveals that the universe operates very differently at tiny scales.

## Key Principles

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
- Particles like electrons and photons exhibit properties of both waves and particles
- They can behave as particles (localized objects) or waves (spread out) depending on how they are observed
- This is demonstrated in the double-slit experiment

### 2. Quantization of Energy
- Energy is not continuous but comes in discrete packets called quanta
- Energy levels in atoms are quantized, meaning electrons can only occupy specific energy states
- Transitions between levels emit or absorb specific amounts of energy

### 3. Uncertainty Principle
- Proposed by Werner Heisenberg, it states that certain pairs of properties cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision
- The more precisely you know position, the less precisely you can know momentum (and vice versa)
- This is a fundamental limitation, not a measurement limitation

### 4. Superposition
- A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured
- When observed, it "collapses" into one definite state
- Schrödinger's cat is a famous thought experiment illustrating this concept

### 5. Entanglement
- Two or more particles can become entangled, meaning their quantum states are correlated
- Measuring one particle instantly affects the state of the other, regardless of distance
- Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance"

## Applications

- **Semiconductors & Electronics**: Understanding quantum effects is crucial for transistors and diodes
- **Lasers**: Based on stimulated emission and quantum energy levels
- **Nuclear Energy**: Involves quantum nuclear reactions
- **Medical Imaging**: PET scans use antimatter and quantum principles
- **Quantum Computing**: Uses quantum bits (qubits) for computation

## Fundamental Constants

- **Planck's Constant (h)**: 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s - defines the scale of quantum effects
- **Speed of Light (c)**: 3 × 10⁸ m/s
- **Avogadro's Number**: 6.022 × 10²³ particles/mole

## Conclusion

Quantum physics fundamentally changed our understanding of reality. It shows that at tiny scales, the universe is probabilistic rather than deterministic, and observation plays an active role in determining physical outcomes. While counterintuitive, quantum mechanics has been validated by countless experiments and is essential to modern technology.
